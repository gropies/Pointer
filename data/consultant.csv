Mars & Co’s global footprint also provides consultants opportunities to work with colleagues from our other offices in North America, Europe, and Asia, as well as the opportunity to travel to both domestically and internationally thus learning how businesses operate globally.

Mars & Co has a strict “promotion from within” philosophy. ACs are considered for promotion to Senior Associate Consultant once they have demonstrated their ability to add meaningful value to project teams and have mastered all the responsibilities of their position. Typically, high performing ACs have achieved these milestones within 18 to 24 months of joining the firm; however there is no set pattern for promotion.

Business Analyst,Efficio,4.4 ★,,– New York,"Vacancy Name Business Analyst - New York
Location City New York
About Us Started in 2000, Efficio is a specialist management consultancy, focused on procurement and supply chain improvement programs. There are currently c.350 employees globally, with exciting plans to grow rapidly in the next 18 months. We are a truly international organisation with over 30 different languages spoken. The firm places a high value on its employees and offers great training and development opportunities, to help with career progression. Our consultants return to their home office each Friday from their client engagement to spend time with their colleagues and attend training courses.
Description Given the growth that Efficio is going through, we are looking for Business Analysts (BAs) to provide support to project teams working on consulting assignments.
Business Analysts roles are targeted at graduate entry level candidates and are the first step into management consulting.
Although based out of our New York office, our BAs will be on client site up to 4 days a week and therefore need to be flexible to travel.

Working under the guidance of an experienced consultant, their key role is to collect, analyse and synthesise data from a variety of sources. The insights and understandings from their analysis provide important inputs to the project team's recommendations and solutions.

BAs also provide input to client presentations, and work with other team members on day-to-day delivery of projects - for example, they may assist with developing and issuing RFPs and evaluating proposals from suppliers. They interact with clients and their suppliers as needed.

BAs are typically involved in client facing projects at client sites from day one, so they need to be able to learn fast and get up to speed quickly and work effectively under pressure. They must be able to work independently, while also being team players who are willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.

BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas. However, they are also expected to be able to justify their conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous, fact-based analysis.

Efficio has a collaborative, supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated. BAs are supported to continually develop their skills and expertise through a comprehensive training and development programme including formal training (through the Efficio Academy), on-the-job training, and coaching and mentoring from experienced consultants and Efficio executives. The opportunities and support that come from a role as an Efficio BA make it an unmatched springboard into a top-tier consulting career.
Essential Requirements • An exemplary academic background; preferably with a top degree in Engineering, Science, Business, or Economics
Must have the right to work in the USA
Desirable Requirements • Strong analytical skills and problem solving ability
Ability to isolate key issues and draw sound conclusions
Proficiency in the use of Excel and PowerPoint
Proactive, inquiring approach
Strong communicator with the ability to influence stakeholders"

As the initial contact point, either by phone, on-line or in person, your sales focus is to connect with prospective residents and showcase the differences that make Griffis Residential unique.

Sales and marketing at GR isn't like any other apartment building, property or real estate office. You are a part of a team that is redefining property management. As a Sales and Leasing Agent, you are a key player, leading GR’s efforts to shape and define a great experience for our existing and prospective residents.

As a Sales and Leasing Agent, your day starts out reviewing the units and the grounds to ensure that they exceed GR standards for presentation. Whether it's staging units or working with the service team to ensure the sprinkler is watering foliage and not the walkway, your customer service attention ensures that the property is in showcase condition. Combining the best of inside sales and outside sales, you engage with prospective residents by greeting them face to face, responding to on-line and phone inquiries or showing units. In this entry level role, your focus is to connect with each individual and build a sincere relationship matching their needs with GR’s offerings.

Additionally, as a Sales and Leasing Agent you will:
Answer prospective residents' questions including pricing and showing apartment communities
Prepare leasing agreements
Follow up on prospects and leads
Coordinate marketing efforts by ensuring signage is correctly placed and online ads are accurate and appropriately positioned
