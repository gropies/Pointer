Heinz Journal,90700,6," Students get 6 Pass/Fail credits per term for participating in the journal activities. Students can be involved in editing, radio programs where the students discuss policy issues either among themselves or with a guest speaker, managing the website, promoting the journal activities, or by organizing and moderating Forum. Enrollment is restricted and can be done only by the instructor. Students interested in editing roles need to take a qualifying exam. Recruitment and enrollment takes place at the beginning of the Fall, and Spring semesters.",
Diversity and Inclusion,90701,12," Issue Definition: Recent events have laid bare the degree to which prejudice and discrimination continue to mar American political, social, and economic life. Fortunately, new technology and advances in the social sciences provide today’s leaders with new tools to identify, quantify, and fight discriminatory practices. Drawing upon existing courses, resources, and partnerships within CMU and the broader Pittsburgh community, the Heinz College has an opportunity to be a national leader in the development and application of 21st century tools to combat these longstanding social problems. However, there is not currently an organized framework or structure that brings these resources together into a cohesive and accessible program of coursework, community engagement, and active learning. The members of this project will design such a framework, thereby establishing the Heinz College as a destination of choice for students who want to combine a passion for justice, equity, and inclusion with training in 21st century technology and data analytics. Scope of Work: The student team would engage in four streams of work. The first will be to conduct “focus group” studies with Heinz students, especially members of historically underrepresented minority groups. These conversations will seek to better understand the needs and interests of these groups within our community, and obtain a sense of the kind of comprehensive framework of courses and activities that would appeal to them. The second stream will take an inventory of existing courses available at CMU and the University of Pittsburg that deal with discrimination from historical, cultural, philosophical, economic, and statistical perspectives. Special emphasis will be placed on courses that deal with 21st century issues such as algorithmic bias and the identification of discriminatory practices from economic or commercial data. Where important gaps exist, the student team may propose the creation of one or two courses or minis. The third stream will focus on community engagement in the Pittsburgh region. A number of energetic local nonprofit groups, including the Greater Pittsburgh chapter of the Urban League, Vibrant Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Community Services, Inc., YWCA Greater Pittsburgh, NAACP and the Pittsburgh African-American Chamber of Commerce have spent years (or even decades) actively engaged in the promotion of a more inclusive and just community. The governments of the city and county also seek to promote a more diverse and inclusive greater Pittsburgh region, as do major employer organizations like the Allegheny Conference. Members of the student team will consider how to engage more actively with these organizations through a regular “diversity and inclusion” speaker series and through a steady stream of substantive summer internships with community organizations and local governments. This work stream will also consider how students interested in fighting discrimination and promoting equity could apply their talents through projects focused on solving real problems in our region and beyond. Examples might include studies of discrimination in police activity, student suspensions, and commercial lending. The final work stream would be to bring all of these pieces together, creating an integrated program of coursework, community engagement, and positive action that enables students passionate about equity and justice to train themselves for a lifetime of leadership in effective social change, using modern tools to fight these longstanding problems. Available Data: Each mode of analysis profiled above would rely on an associated data stream. Focus groups would draw upon the insights of existing Heinz College students and recent graduates, with an emphasis on the views and opinions of members of underrepresented minority groups. The course inventory and development stream would draw upon not only the existing course catalog of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, but also on the insights of leading scholars at these universities whose teaching and research mission connects to the domains of equity and inclusion. The community engagement section would leverage the connections that have been created in the past semester by a related systems synthesis project focused on recruitment and retention of African-American executives in the Pittsburgh region as well as the personal network of the faculty adviser. Expected Deliverable: The student team will create an integrated curricular plan for Dean Ramayya Krishnan and his leadership team. This plan will identify existing courses (and, where critical gaps exist, propose new courses or minis) that could enable Heinz students to understand the causes and consequences of discriminatory practices from multiple perspectives. It will show how students interested in this domain could educate themselves through a pathway of coursework, engage with the local community in ways that reinforce and deepen the lessons learned in the classroom, and harness the Heinz College’s strengths in analytics and technology to find new solutions to longstanding problems. Skills Required: This project offers a rare opportunity for Heinz students to work together on a project that could strengthen the ability of the Heinz College and its curriculum to contend with modern issues of equity and inclusion. It would draw upon nearly the full set of skills developed in the core curriculum, including (but not limited to) statistics, econometrics, applied economic analysis, analytical techniques from management science, cost-benefit analysis, and high-level professional communications skills.",
Women and Public Policy,90703,6," This course will examine some of the cutting edge social and professional issues surrounding women today. Its purpose is to analyze and discuss the nature of women’s participation in a number of economic and political activities, as well as the impact that specific policies have on women. Students will have the opportunity to explore some of these critical issues through the readings, presentations and class discussions. Since this is a mini course we will not be able to cover the entire range of issues affecting women. Instead, we will try to cover a few specific areas focusing on some of the psychological, legal and political issues that impede the advancement of women. We will also try to assess the progress made by women in the last decade.","Learning Outcomes: Students will develop these analytical skills in different forms: a) Class discussions which will allow the students to develop the ability to analyze, discuss, and defend different policy positions in an academic environment b) Writing a policy memo: It is critical for all of us to be able to summarize a problem, present possible solutions, and recommend policies/solutions to others. The policy memos allow the students to develop these very important skills. Typically, students are expected to assume the role of a policy maker and provide specific policies to the President or another important policy maker. The policy memos emphasize the use of relevant data, the analysis of the problem, and the policy design. c) Group presentation and paper: Group presentations are geared to allow the student to develop the ability to work in a project with other students, learn about a specific topic in depth, and prepare a class presentation either using power point or class handouts. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the presentation the instructor meets with the student about a week before the presentation to set the specific topics and parameters of the presentation. The handout or slides need to be submitted to the instructor at least 24hours before the presentation. The slides or handouts will be reviewed by the instructor in order to verify the effectiveness of the presentation. d) Analytical essays: The final exam consists of two analytical essays and/ or policy memos."
"Poverty, Inequality and Social Policies",90704,12," In her book Social Forces and States Judith Teichman argues that “significant and long term improvement in distributional outcomes is a daunting political task [that requires] a strong societal consensus on the importance of the reduction in inequality, one that compels political leaders to make difficult policy changes.” Teichman’s words indicate that poverty and inequality are not just socioeconomic problems, but critical political and policy problems both in the U.S. and in the rest of the world and this class attempts to tackle some of those complex problems. This course is divided in four sections: a) The first one discusses the global nature of inequality and what can be done to reduce its impact. b) The second section will focus on poverty and anti-poverty policies pursued in the U.S. c) The third section focuses on three middle income countries: Chile, Mexico and South Korea. In this section the focus is on the role that social forces and the state play in the generation of socioeconomic responses to poverty and inequality as well as the impact of Conditional Cash Transfers d) The fourth section analyses poverty, the behavior of the poor and antipoverty policies in very poor countries or regions of the world. It also discusses micro-financing and Unconditional Transfers",
Public Policy Analysis,90705,12," This course provides students with a foundational understanding of public policy as an academic discipline and as a professional practice in both advanced and less advanced political economies. The course introduces the theoretical roots of the discipline and the analytical approaches that define and drive it. The students will be exposed to the complex actors and institutions involved in the shaping and implementation of public policy, and the various types of approaches, methods, and tools used in different policy arenas. Students will explore in depth the complexities of the various phases of the policy process: agenda-setting, policy formulation, decision-making, implementation, and evaluation. The exploration of these various phases will be through discussions of cases of public policy problems in various countries with different governance environments.","Learning Outcomes: At the end of this class, the students are expected to demonstrate the following: • knowledge of key concepts in public policy and public management; • ability to analyse and define problems and to set policy agendas accordingly; • capacity to apply various approaches in developing policy options, devising implementation strategies and conducting evaluation of policies; • competency in communicating analysis and findings clearly in their written work and in verbal presentations."
Public Finance: Theories and Cases,90706,12," This course builds on the methods and techniques covered in Policy Analysis I. The first half concentrates on elaboration of a theoretical framework for policy analysis. This requires a considerable reading load consisting of both theory and cases for analysis. The second half of the subject is devoted to some specific aspects of the policy analysis process. This allows us to apply theories to issues such as causation in behavioural theory; the special challenges presented by environmental and infrastructure issues; policy and regulatory practice, including agency capture; and public private partnerships. The final two classes deal with two big issues: Acemoglu’s theory on why nations fail; and the debate on inequality. At the end of this class, the students should be able to accomplish the following: • Critically evaluate policy recommendations using standard tools of policy analysis; • Prepare a sound, evidence-based policy advice and understand the limitations of the use of evidence in policy-making • Apply normative and political theory to policy-making • Research policy using a wide range of sources • Apply policy analytic techniques to complex issues such as environmental policy; public private partnerships; health policy interventions; and policy for addressing inequality",
Statistical Reasoning,90707,12," This course will provide an introduction to the principles of data collection, description and analysis. You will learn the basic tools of statistical inference and modeling, as well as how to interpret results, measure the uncertainty in result, and understand the limitations of results. You will also learn how to interpret statistical output, and how not to be fooled by statistical studies.","Learning Outcomes: At the end of this course, you should be able to - Present data visually in tabular and graphic form - Summarize a set of observations by reporting a measure of center and dispersion - Explain how and why sample data can be used to estimate descriptive measures of populations when census data is unavailable, and how we measure the accuracy and precision of the estimate - Apply the basic rules of probability - Find and interpret the probability for a random variable which has a normal distribution - Explain how to take a proper scientific sample that can be used to make inferences about the larger population - Explain what sampling error is and why it exists - Classify data by type and use the proper summary statistics and tests for the data type - Interpret the p-value, test statistic and other Minitab output from a test of hypotheses, confidence interval, and linear regression"
Intermediate Economic Analysis,90709,12," This is a course in economics relevant to public policy and management for those who already have some familiarity and facility with basic economics. In this course we will focus on microeconomics, which is the study of individuals, firms, and markets.","Learning Outcomes: • Be familiar with microeconomic concepts and analysis that are essential to good managerial and policy decisions. • Be able to use economic analysis in evaluating public policy issues. • Be able to apply these concepts and analysis in other courses taken at Heinz, e.g., Management Science, Financial Analysis, Budgeting and Management Control Systems, Negotiation, Public Policy and the Internet, Systems Synthesis, etc. • Be able to critically evaluate economic arguments in public policy debates. You should be able to understand and critically evaluate articles and op-eds about economics in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. You will be able to impress and amaze friends and family with your deep insights and critical understanding of current economic events when such discussions arise over the cheese dip or arguing with your Uncle Edgar."
Applied Economic Analysis,90710,12," Microeconomics is the study of how individuals and firms make choices, and how these choices interact in society. Economics shares with other behavioral sciences the general goal of explaining and predicting human behavior. The distinguishing feature of the economic approach is the emphasis on rational decision making under conditions of scarcity. Because of the central role of markets and the price system in describing the outcome of individual and firm decision-making, microeconomics is sometimes called “price theory.” This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and tools of microeconomics. We study how markets work, with an emphasis on analysis of the effects of public policy on the welfare of society. The course also provides a brief introduction to macroeconomics.","Learning Outcomes: By the end of this term you should: Develop a deep understanding of a small number of core concepts of microeconomics that are essential to good managerial decision making and informed analysis of any economic issue. Develop an ability to use key economic ideas in evaluating public policies. You should leave this course with a basic understanding of what types of government intervention benefit society. You also will be informed about a number of current issues confronting policy makers. Be acquainted with a few important ideas in macroeconomics, such as the determinants of economic growth, the causes and consequences of inflation and unemployment, and the role of monetary and fiscal policy. Develop an ability to critically analyze economic arguments put forth in public policy debates. For instance, you should be able to read and evaluate general economics-related material in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, or Economist."
Statistical Reasoning with R,90711,12," Statistical reasoning is essential to learning from data and understanding the strengths and limitations of data analyses. This course is grounded in questions of importance in public policy and focuses on how data and statistical reasoning can inform those questions. We will use a hands-on approach to develop skills and critical thinking in the fundamentals of causal inference, univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics, prediction, linear regression, uncertainty, and statistical inference. The hands-on approach involves learning the basics of how to use the R statistical language and weekly labs in which students will use R to carry out and interpret data analysis on real-world policy issues in a supervised setting. While useful, no R or computer programming experience is required for the course, and this course does not replace the stand-alone R course.",Learning Outcomes: The objectives of the course are to provide students with the ability to: 1 Use statistics to summarize patterns in raw data; 2 Use data to infer cause and effect relationships; 3 Use probability to characterize uncertainty; 4 Calculate and interpret confidence intervals and perform and interpret hypothesis tests; 5 Perform and interpret regression analyses; 6 Use the statistical software package Minitab; 7 Prepare you for more advanced statistical courses.
Policy and Politics an International Perspective,90713,12," The goal of this course is to examine critical foreign policy issues and actors. The first section will focus on critical issues in the Middle East including the 2011 uprisings and their consequences for the region as well as U.S. relations with selected Middle Eastern countries. U.S. relations with Pakistan, India and Afghanistan will be briefly analyzed as well. The section on China will provide a detailed analysis of Chinese foreign policy and China’s transformation into a major international power in the last thirty years. This section will focus on China’s strategic and national security policies, China’s role in the world economy, and China’s relations with the U.S., Taiwan, Japan, S. and N. Korea. The current conflicts in the S. China Sea and U.S., Chinese and S. East Asian policies in this critical region will be analyzed as well. The last section of the course will discuss Russia’s role in the international economic and political system, U.S. and China relations with Africa and Latin America and the Obama Doctrine.","Learning Outcomes: At the end of the course the students are expected to have acquired: a) The main analytic methods and approaches used in international relations. b) In depth knowledge of the nature of the Chinese government, its approach to foreign policy, as well as China’s impact on the world political and economic systems c) In depth knowledge of major issues affecting the Middle East and the U.S. role in that region d) The nature and impact of the conflicts in the South China Sea e) Major problems affecting the international position and power of Russia, and Latin American and African countries’ relations with China and the U.S."
Policy And Politics In American Political Institutions,90714,12," The purpose of this course is to study the structure of the American government, the main actors in the policy process, as well as critical policy issues. The emphasis will be on the study of the central political institutions: The Presidency and Congress, as well as critical decisions of the Supreme Court and their societal impact. The course will also emphasize the analysis of critical socio-economic policies including social and educational policies, among others. We will also analyze Supreme Court decisions regarding minorities’ rights, gender issues, and voting rights among others. Throughout the course students will be encouraged to analyze and discuss the evolution of key political and policy issues. We will place special emphasis on the interactions between government and society and the role of social and interest groups in the process.",
Writing for Public Policy,90717,6," Communication in written form is an essential element of being a public policy professional. Writing for consulting firms, government agencies, think tanks, advocacy groups, industry associations, and other contexts in the sphere of public policy differs from academic writing. Accordingly, this course challenges students to convey critical thinking by anticipating readers’ needs and the perspectives of stakeholders in the practice of shaping public policy. The writing skills integral to this process include: developing essential and persuasive content, communicating complex ideas, organizing information, targeting diverse audiences with varying levels of expertise and roles, ensuring clarity, moderating tone, and maintaining format norms. Students will analyze real-world documents relevant to careers in public policy, craft strategic quotes for news releases, as well as write policy one-pagers and memos. Writing resources and sample documents (e.g. fact sheets, one-pagers, policy briefs and memos, press releases, proposals for funding, etc.) will be provided.",
Strategic Presentation Skills,90718,6," Achieving career success requires the ability to successfully meet a wide range of communication challenges – convincing stakeholders to take action, working the room at networking events, motivating project teams, fielding tough questions from clients and/or the media, facilitating meetings in ways that foster open conversation and collaboration. In short, today’s leaders must convey their messages clearly, confidently, and persuasively. Whether you’re looking for a job, seeking a promotion, preparing to pitch a new technology, or simply looking to have your voice heard, Strategic Presentation Skills will give your ideas the force and credibility they need in today’s marketplace. Topics include: conducting stakeholder analysis, managing speaking anxiety, speaking confidently and concisely at job interviews, designing slides that maximize visual appeal and speed up information sharing, identifying and implementing effective persuasive strategies, using elements of voice and body to establish presence and credibility in front of a live audience, and using narrative to engage listeners. This course assumes basic proficiency in English and is aimed at both novice and more experienced speakers.",
Physical Technical Systems I,90719,12," Information: May be taken to fulfill Systems Synthesis requirement (second year only) Physical Technical Systems introduces students of public management to important technological issues which they will face in their professional careers. The course focuses on research and presentation of formal oral and written reports. Students learn how to identify a problem, structure and analyze the problem, and generate conclusions and recommendations in much the same way that they would as policy analysts or managers. Students work with a client or decision maker. In addition to building research and problem-solving skills, students gain practice in working as part of a professional team operating in a research environment that addresses technical, social, and political issues. For this reason, Physical Technical Systems courses are undertaken jointly with the Heinz School, the Department of Engineering and Public Policy, and Department of Social and Decision Sciences. Every Physical Technical Systems course addresses a different real-world problem, often for a real client. To learn the topic(s) for next semester, as well as topics from the last few years, see http://www.cmu.edu/epp/prospective/undergraduate/epp-project-courses",

Health Care Management,90721,6," This course introduces students to the knowledge and skills required to strategically manage the rapidly changing internal and external environment of health care organizations. Through readings, lectures, class discussions and case reviews, the course is designed to provide students with a foundation in contemporary health care organizational structures and management practices. Students will explore problems and decisions facing health care executives in areas such as clinical quality, organizational effectiveness, efficiency, growth, stakeholder conflicts, provider incentives, margin versus mission tradeoffs, human resources, strategic planning and the like, all in a highly complex political environment. A primary theme of this course is the application of ethical management practices as codified in the American College of Healthcare Executives’ Code of Ethics. By providing a general overview of the responsibilities of health care leaders and managers, students will have a contextual reference for the application of future coursework.","Learning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to: 1. Delve into the primary components and functions of health care provider organizations 2. Assess the unique challenges involved in managing complex health care organizations 3. Appraise the motivations and interests of key internal and external stakeholders and the role of the health care executive in managing expectations and communicating with these stakeholders 4.

Management Science I: Optimization and Multicriteria Methods,90722,6," This course, along with its companions (90-760 Management Science II: Decision and Risk Modeling, 94-833 Decision Analysis and Multi-Criteria Decision Making, and 95-760 Decision Making Under Uncertainty) are introductory courses in analytics and management science that survey a variety of hands-on quantitative and modeling methods useful to decision makers and analysts. 90-722 focuses on optimization models and methods. Normally Heinz PPM, HCPM, MBTM, and MEIM students take 90-722 & 90-760, whereas MISM students take 95-760 which pulls examples from the information systems context. Both tracks feed into 94-833, although students with a strong quantitative background can take 94-833 in the first year; none of the other courses are actually a prerequisite for 94-833.","Learning Outcomes: These courses have four objectives. First, you should become as comfortable working with spreadsheets, spreadsheet tools, and various add-ins as you already should be with word processors. By the end of the course, firing up Excel to model and solve a quantitative problem should be second nature. This skill will be a significant asset on the job market and in your career. Second, you should learn about a variety of techniques, what they are capable of, and what their limitations are so that you can intelligently call upon management science specialists and consultants when the occasion arises. Third, you should acquire sufficient proficiency with some of the techniques that you can use them as an “end user modeler”. Fourth, you should learn how to approach, abstract, and analyze problems from a quantitative, analytical perspective. In short, you should be able to use the language and perspective of mathematical modeling. In most lectures we will work through a small “case” to help you connect the methods to a problem that is richer than the typical end of chapter problem."
Financial Statements and Analysis of Companies,90723,6," This course provides an overview of how managers, investors, creditors, and other parties use financial information to assess the financial and operating performance of companies. The first part of the course looks at how a company's transactions are measured, recorded and presented to stakeholders. In the second part of the course you will use the Annual Report and Form 10-K that is prepared by publicly held companies to evaluate and analyze the financial status of a company for which you have no information except the annual published financial report or financial statements.","Learning Outcomes: At the end of this course, you should be able to: - Prepare a Balance Sheet and Income Statement for a simple organization - Given the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Cash Flows and other information in an actual organization’s audited financial statements, compute relevant ratios and analyze the Financial Condition and Operating Position of the company or NPO. - Locate financial and other related information for companies in their Annual Report and 10-K"
Financial Analysis,90724,12," This course provides an overview of how managers, investors, creditors, donors, foundations, and other parties use financial information to make decisions in organizations. It includes tools of both financial and managerial accounting. Unit 1 focuses on the financial reports and analysis of the financial position and the operating results of business organizations. You will learn several techniques such as common sizing, trend analysis and ratio analysis to help you analyze an organization for which you have no information except the annual published financial report. Exam #1 will be given at the end of Unit 1. The second part of the course, Unit 2, looks at the financial reports of organizations in the private (non-government) not-for-profit sector. We will compare and contrast the reporting and analysis of these NPOs with that of businesses, and discuss the needs for different information and performance measures in the private not-for-profits. Exam #2 will be given at the end of Unit 2. In the last unit, Unit 3, we look at organizations not as an outsider (investor, donor, creditor), but instead as a manager inside the organization. You will learn how to use several financial tools available to managers such as budgets, decision making tools, and break even analysis, and how to predict or measure the financial impact of different alternatives. This is often referred to as managerial accounting. The final exam covers the material in Unit 3.","Learning Outcomes: At the end of this course, you should be able to Prepare a Balance Sheet and Income Statement for a simple organization Given the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Cash Flows and other information in an actual organization’s audited financial statements, compute relevant ratios and analyze the Financial Condition and Operating Position of the company or NPO.

Management Accounting,90725,6," Information provided by external financial reporting (financial statements) is compiled too late and is too aggregated for managers to use in making strategic decisions. However, this same accounting information can be accessed, disaggregated and analyzed to get the information necessary for strategic planning. Purpose: The purpose of this class is to familiarize students with the language and techniques of managerial accounting and to develop and sharpen analytic abilities. This course focuses as much as possible on the practical application of managerial analysis. Students will learn the key analytical skills for both planning and evaluating past performance. This course relies heavily on performing calculations (number crunching) and interpreting the results. Material is presented in a combination of lecture and modeling cases. It is assumed that participants have a general knowledge of accounting as well as a basic knowledge of Excel. Format: The sessions each week are generally divided into two parts, lecture and a lab in which students implement managerial accounting techniques by developing models in Excel. Homework assignments will ask students to evaluate a business situation, make, and support their decision based on their analysis.","Learning Outcomes: Objectives of the course: • Master common managerial accounting techniques like Cost Volume Profit Analysis, Product and service costing and the impact on pricing, overhead allocation, Activity Based Costing, budgeting and performance analysis and long term Investment decision making.. • Make and communicate recommendations that are supported by relevant data. • Develop skills to build flexible financial models and to use sensitivity analysis to evaluate opportunities and deal with problems skillfully."
Money & Politics,90726,6," Money threatens to overwhelm the American political system, as the ""cost"" of running for public office rises in each subsequent election. Add the money spent to influence the passage of legislation and the conduct of government, and you have a system awash with dollars. The 2000 elections for President and the U.S. Congress, once again, set new records, as more than $3 billion were pumped into the political system. Beyond the campaigns, millions are spend each year by companies, unions, and special interest groups to lobby and otherwise affect decision-making at all levels of government. Raising and spending money by elected officials and those who seek to influence them has become an indelible part of the American governmental process. This ""mini"" course examines the role money plays in both election to public office and subsequent policy-making, the current rules that govern the actions of those who want to affect governmental outcomes, and the various proposals to reform the effect of money on the political and governmental process.","Learning Outcomes: When the course concludes, the student will have heard directly from lobbyists, campaign managers, and candidates about the importance of money and the kinds of reforms that might be useful. The goal is to have each student both understand the current process and then think critically about the many proposals offered to reform the impact of money on our current system of campaign finance and policy-making."
Introduction to Database Management,90728,6," Databases provide a powerful tool for any policy analyst and are the information backbones of organizations of all kinds. This course introduces the relational database model, entity-relationship diagrams, data flow diagrams, structured query language by example, forms, and macros using the Microsoft Access database package. Applications include data import cleaning and aggregation for policy analysis and database systems for delivery and management of services.",Learning Outcomes: Formulate basic and advanced relational database queries using a query tool such as Access’s Query by Example. Create database queries using Structured Query Language (SQL) Describe the rationale for the basic design principals of relational databases such as referential integrity and foreign keys. Interpret an entity relationship diagram for an existing relational database including participation and cardinality. Create an entity relationship diagram based on an organization’s data and business rules. Create a physical relational database design based on an entity relationship diagram. Design and implement simple customized database user interfaces including forms and reports using a development tool. Use macros to automate the use of Access and Excel for data analysis.
Methods Of Policy Analysis,90730,12," PREREQUISITES This course is designed for students at the Heinz College School of Public Policy and Management who have skills equivalent to those taught in the School’s core courses in economic analysis, statistical methods, management science, financial analysis, organizational design, policy and politics, and professional writing. In particular, a good understanding of economics and statistics, and an understanding of American government institutions and programs, will be required to understand most of the class discussions and readings. Students will need to utilize principles and methodologies from all of these disciplines in carrying out some of the assignments for the course. OBJECTIVES If you successfully complete this course, you will: 1. Have an in-depth understanding of several complex policy issues in diverse substantive areas. 2. Understand the major steps in the policy analysis and development process, including (a) how and when policy issues become important, and (b) how policy initiatives are developed, analyzed, presented, implemented, evaluated, and terminated. 3. Understand a number of common pitfalls in policy analysis and how to avoid them; 4. Improve your ability to think critically about policy issues, think creatively and analytically about alternatives for addressing the issues, and think practically about successful implementation of recommended alternatives. 5. Develop experience in doing both quick turnaround and in-depth policy analyses on complex policy issues. 6. Improve your skills in communication of policy analyses to decision-makers. 7. Understand what it is like to work as a policy analyst in a government or civic agency and what techniques can be used to increase your effectiveness in that role. Successful policy analysis in real-world settings is far more than being able to collect data, run regressions, use optimization models, or identify market failures. It involves: - anticipating issues that will need analysis; - determining whether problems are real and what is causing them; - defining and prioritizing the goals to be achieved in addressing the problems; - developing creative alternatives to address the problems; - carrying out accurate and complete analyses of the impacts of alternatives, including consideration of qualitative and political considerations; - developing recommendations that can be implemented effectively; - presenting analyses and recommendations both orally and in writing in ways that will actually influence decisions; - resolving ethical dilemmas in conflicting roles; and - in general, confidently applying critical thinking skills. Rather than defer the development of these skills to the ""school of hard knocks"" (i.e., a real policy analysis job), this course is designed to teach you some key principles which can provide guidance in carrying out policy analyses, and also to provide some practical experience in applying those principles to realistic policy problems. The course will provide an understanding of how public policies are actually developed, analyzed, and implemented, and of the role of the policy analyst at each of these stages. The examples used will primarily be real-world cases, with all the complexity that implies. Although this is called a ""methods"" course, the primary “methods” it will teach are strategies for thinking critically and creatively about public policy problems and solutions and ways for helping government leaders to make good decisions about public policies. Statistics, econometrics, operations research, financial analysis, and other sophisticated analytical tools are taught in depth in many other courses at the Heinz College and elsewhere at Carnegie Mellon; the Methods of Policy Analysis course is not intended to teach more of these types of methodologies. Instead, this course is focused on enabling students to apply appropriate analytic tools to real-world problems within real-world constraints on data and time. During the course, you will learn by doing analyses yourself and by discussing how to analyze problems in class, rather than (merely) reading books or articles or listening to lectures. You will examine several different complex policy problems in depth, and you will jointly (through class discussion) and individually (through assignments) assess the importance and causes of these policy problems, develop alternative approaches for addressing them, evaluate the impacts of those alternatives, and grapple with the complex and often conflicting considerations involved in making recommendations for action. The specific policy problems have been selected to expose you to a range of substantive areas (e.g., criminal justice, economic development, education, energy, environmental protection, health, and human services) and to a range of generic types of public policies (e.g., regulations, entitlement programs, incentives, etc.). One of the goals of the course is to demonstrate that the ideas, techniques, and experience in one substantive area can provide important lessons for tackling problems in other, seemingly very different substantive areas, and consequently that there is a benefit to learning about and doing policy analyses on issues in diverse areas. Moreover, even if you intend to focus your career on policy issues in a particular area, the job market may not cooperate during the early stages of your career; consequently, many students have found it valuable to develop some knowledge and experience in policy areas beyond those in which they are primarily interested. The course will also examine in depth each of the stages in the policy analysis process, beginning with the factors that determine which policy problems will be dealt with by policy-makers, and continuing with some of the principles and pitfalls involved in analyzing problems,developing and analyzing alternatives, and implementing policies and programs in a political environment. These discussions will draw on a wide range of policy examples and detailed cases that demonstrate the principles being discussed. The topics discussed in class are limited to U.S. domestic policy issues. Foreign policy and defense policy issues are not discussed, although the approaches to analyzing problems taught in the class will be applicable to many aspects of these issues. Since the cases and assignments deal with U.S. domestic policy issues in some depth, you need to have a reasonable degree of familiarity with U.S. federal, state, and local government institutions and programs to understand the class discussions and successfully carry out the assignments. International students without this level of understanding may experience some difficulty and they will likely need to spend extra time doing background research on the topics. Effective written and oral communications are essential skills for a policy analyst. The ability to clearly and convincingly convey the results of an analysis to a decision-maker can make the difference between whether an analysis has an impact on policy or is ignored. Poor grammar, confusing style, and typographical errors in written materials can do as much or more to reduce the credibility of an analysis as inaccuracies in calculation or improper use of quantitative methodologies. Consequently, in the assignments in the course, you will be expected to produce well-written memoranda and other materials. A significant portion of the grade for each assignment will be based on the quality of your writing and the thoroughness of your proofreading, and failing grades will be given to assignments that are difficult to understand or have been poorly proofread.",
Government Accounting,90731,6," This course is designed to develop an understanding of governmental accounting, as well as key disciplines of financial management in state & local governments. Specifically, the course will emphasize the ability to read and understand basic financial statements and the comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR), how generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) apply to state & local government, fund accounting, and other financial reporting components. Students will also be introduced to the fundamental principles of state & local government financial management including budget development, long-term financial planning, debt management, and retirement benefits, and will become familiar with how all of these elements can be used to help accomplish organizational goals and objectives for state & local governments.",
Urban Policy,90734,6," This course will examine economic forces and public policies that have shaped modern cities and metropolitan areas in the US and other countries. We will explore government policies contributing to metropolitan form as well as policies in community development, affordable housing, workforce development and the environment designed to mitigate those policies. We will conclude with a discussion of policies to support sustainable urban growth. The course will concentrate on the physical, geographical and built aspects of metro areas, but will also address the relationship between the physical nature and the quality of community that develops, focusing on low-income communities. Guest speakers will provide examples of how selected public policies are implemented in Pittsburgh.","Learning Outcomes: You will be able to identify policies that have shaped the physical environment of metropolitan areas and understand the impact of those policies on low income populations, the role of NGOs as change agents and the importance of civic engagement in a region’s quality of life."
Public Finance,90736,12," Full description can be found here: http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rs9f/public_finance.pdf The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the theory and practice of how government finances itself from both positive and normative points of view. To accomplish this, the course reviews: i] rationales for government intervention in the market place, ii] analyzes methods of resolving conflicts over the size of the public sector budget, iii] extensively analyzes the rationales and issues of various sources of public revenue, and iv] reviews the effects of public sector spending and taxes on the aggregate economy. While the examples are largely drawn from the United States, examples are also drawn from other industrial democracies and non-democracies. Because the subject matter of public spending and revenues can easily consume an entire academic year of study, Public Finance focuses mainly on the revenue side of the public budget. Two courses typically offered by Professor Strauss in the Spring build on Public Finance. Public Expenditure Analysis (90-774) deals with techniques for evaluating private and public expenditure and capital spending decisions. Regional Finance and Education Policy (90-817) deals in-depth with issues surrounding multi-level government finance from US and international perspectives. Regional Finance and Education Policy presumes the material covered in Public Finance; students interested in taking Regional Finance and Education Policy should take Public Finance. It is suggested that students interested in Public Expenditure Analysis also take Public Finance.",
Budget Management Control System,90737,12," This course provides an introduction to the design and use of systems that assist management in ensuring that organizations achieve their goals. It emphasizes budgets as a major component of management control systems for for-profit, governmental and non-profit organizations.

Applied Economics Analysis II,90738,12," This is an introductory course on macroeconomics - the study of the performance of national economy as well as the policies used to improve that performance. Unlike microeconomics, which focuses on the behavior of individual households, firms, and markets, macroeconomics takes a bird’s eye view of the economy. The key topics include measuring macroeconomic activities such as GDP, unemployment, price level and inflation; analyzing economy conditions and issues in the long-run and the short-run, as well as the issues of international trade and exchange rates in the international economy. The course is divided into four modules: Module A – Macroeconomics: Issues and Data, which include a bird’s-eye view of the economy; measurement of the economic activity (GDP and unemployment); as well as measurement of the price level and inflation. Module B – Economy in the Long Run, which include the economic growth, productivity and living standards; workers, wages and unemployment in the modern economy; saving and capital formation; money, prices and the Federal Reserve; as well as financial markets and international capital flows. Module C – Economy in the Short Run, which include an introduction of the short-term economic fluctuations; spending and output in the short run; the role of the Fed in stabilizing the economy; inflation, aggregate supply and aggregate demand; as well as the practice and pitfalls of macroeconomic policy. Module D – The International Economy, which include the exchange rates and open economy; as well as international trade.",Learning Outcomes: The primary objectives of this course are: (a) to familiarize you with the language and concepts of macroeconomics; (b) to help you develop critical thinking and sharpen the analytic abilities in macroeconomic issues; and (c) to use the macroeconomic information to make decisions in the private and public organizations.
Systems Synthesis I,90739,12," The Systems Synthesis sequence of courses 90-739 and 90-740 is intended to provide an opportunity for students to work together intensively on the design of a specific functioning system. The term ""System"" refers to the fact that the particular entity studied has an identifiable objective or function, and the word ""Synthesis"" refers to the fact that the desired output is an integrated ""design"" for students to gain experience and understanding in the formulation and solution of problems in the public sector. In doing this, students have an opportunity to integrate the facts and techniques they have learned and put them to a practical test. The operation of the course involves the class in the definition and solution of one or more major public problems. The class examines these problems from relevant viewpoints, including the definition of system objectives, user requirements, as well as the examination of technological and procedural alternatives in designing the systems and consideration of the political problems in implementing solutions. The class project leads ultimately to one or more project reports, and formal presentations are made to advisory panels at the end of each semester.",

Urban And Regional Economic Development,90743,12," Urban and Regional Economic Development refers to efforts to stimulate wealth creation, and increased standard of living and the mitigation of poverty. As the pace of change in the economy quickens, cities and regions are undertaking a variety of programs and policies to attempt to improve local economic outcomes. Too often, these efforts are misinformed, ill conceived or the product of copying apparently successful policies from other locales. The emerging field of economic development is an effort to improve the efficacy of these efforts through the systematic application of economic principles, methods and rigorous policy analysis.","Learning Outcomes: Upon successful completion of this course you should be able to: • Explain key concepts, theories and methods in the pursuit of regional economic development. • Critique the theories and methods of regional economic development in their application to a region. • Examine a regional economy using critical analytical methods like shift share, location quotients, and comparative analysis. • Recommend a regional development strategy based on your theoretical critique and economic analysis. Evaluation and Grading The evaluation for the course consists of a class presentation on your region and a regional assessment policy paper (due in four parts). In consultation with the instructor, you will pick a U.S metropolitan area to analyze during the semester. Using this region, you will learn the tools and techniques for analyzing the economic and demographic characteristics of a region. You will also prepare topical issue presentations based on the readings and their region. The final paper will integrate your analysis and insights. Submit all assignments via Blackboard."
Financial Analysis of Non-Profits,90744,6," In this course you will learn how to access and evaluate financial information of private, not-for-profit organizations in their Form 990 and Audited Financial Statements. Topics covered include measures of effectiveness, measuring and reporting income from contributions, capital campaigns, and endowments, and cash flow analysis. In addition, you will learn how to prepare simple budgets for NPOs and how to use breakeven analysis to optimize management decisions.","Learning Outcomes: Locate financial, governance, and accountability information about NPOs 1 Describe and explain typical accounts found in NPO financial reports 2 Use the relationships between the financial statements and accounts to infer financial activity in a not-for-profit organization 3 Prepare and analyze a five year trend analysis for an NPO 4 Recognize, identify and interpret trends in five-year financial statements 5 Clearly articulate, using proper terminology, the information contained in nonprofit financial statements and the Form 990 and in a five-year trend analysis"
Methods of Policy Analysis - The Future of Work,90745,12," After decades of slow wage growth and rising inequality, many American workers now fear an epidemic of joblessness as new technologies increasingly replace human labor. Is this likely to occur? How will emerging technologies reshape the U.S. labor market? How important is the “gig economy,” and how big might it become? What can policy makers do to ensure that the growth of the American economy is more inclusive and equitable? The curriculum of 90-745 has been rewritten to help Heinz students (and other interested CMU students) think seriously and rigorously about the future of work in the 21st century American economy. The course will place current concerns in the broader context of the major structural shifts in the U.S. labor market over the past several decades. Drawing upon the most recent quantitative analyses, the course will show that technological change has contributed to increasingly unequal outcomes in the U.S. labor market for decades, and that this trend is likely to continue as a new wave of technological change unfolds. The course will also consider the degree to which globalization, immigration, rising monopoly power, declining union strength, minimum wage laws, and discrimination based on race and gender have contributed to rising inequality in U.S. incomes. The course will draw upon frontier research to identify old and new policy ideas that could help make economic growth more inclusive, and it will bring into the classroom policy entrepreneurs who are making a real difference. Students will not just study the problems associated with the future of work – they will also get directly involved in the generation of meaningful solutions by completing original policy analyses for government agencies and nonprofits seeking to make that future more equitable. The course instructor, Professor Lee Branstetter, is a globally recognized expert on the economics of innovation and technological change. He leads the Future of Work research initiative within Carnegie Mellon’s new Block Center for Technology and Society. In 2011-2012, Professor Branstetter served on the staff of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.",
Cost-Benefit Analysis,90747,6," As public policy analysts, we are often presented with making decisions that are economically efficient – that is, how does one gain the most benefit for society, given limited resources? Economics provides the theoretical foundation of decision-making, but putting theory into practice is not always easy. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is an analytical tool used to determine the worth of a project, program, or policy. It identifies and attempts to quantify the costs and benefits of the project or program and provides decision-makers with manageable information to find the “best” outcome. CBA helps managers to answer questions such as: • Does the proposal provide a net benefit to the community as a whole? • Should the project/program/policy be undertaken? • Should the project/program be continued? • Which of the alternative projects should be undertaken? The course employs various economic and statistical techniques to answer these questions, condensed into a 6-week course.",
Real Estate Development,90748,6," Critical to the economic development professional’s toolkit is understanding how and why real estate is developed: what motivates private real estate development, how real estate development is financed, market drivers and the context by which private real estate developers and financiers operate, and the role of public policy and public financing in achieving desired public outcomes. In this class, you will explore the real estate development process, the context by which real estate is developed, valuation and financing methodologies, and the role of the public in supporting private real estate development through a combination of lecture, discussion, and guest speakers. You will have fun building your real estate toolkit. You will meet and learn from practicing real estate development professionals (including me!) and explore real world real estate developments. From main streets to downtown office towers, you will gain a new appreciation and insight into how the places you live, work, and play came to be. Your learning will be assessed through individual take-home assignments, a group case study, class participation, and an in-class presentation. While there are no specific prerequisites for this course, you should have basic Excel modeling skills and basic understanding of finance.","Learning Outcomes: When you have completed this course, you will be able to: - Utilize Floor Area Ratio and leasable square feet calculations to develop a real estate program. - Calculate Net Operating Income (NOI) - Apply valuation methodologies and concepts to real world real estate development. - Perform supportable debt analysis to build a real estate financing capital stack utilizing Net Operating Income and real estate valuation methods. - Create a pro forma real estate cash flow model, analyze economic returns and recognize key drivers and inputs to your pro forma model. - Articulate the role of the public in real estate development and critically analyze the appropriateness and application of a variety of public real estate financing tools and methods-- including understanding real estate financing ‘gaps.’ - Apply your newly acquired skill set and tool box to examine a real estate development opportunity and recommend (in writing and oral presentation) a development program, financing capital stack (including any public financing), pro forma model, economic returns. to a faux board of investors."
The Rise of the Asian Economies,90752,12," For most of the past 40 years, no region of the world has been more economically dynamic than Asia. This economic growth transformed the patterns of world trade, lifted millions out of absolute poverty, and so captivated the attention of Western economists and business leaders that it was commonplace by the early 1990s to refer to the economic achievements of these countries as the “East Asian miracle.” The nature of this apparent miracle changed dramatically over the course of the 1990s as the most advanced economy in the region, Japan, suffered a sharp growth slowdown, and a number of the other ""miracle"" economies were engulfed in a regional economic crisis in the latter half of the decade. These events highlighted weaknesses in the East Asian growth model that had been hidden during the boom years. Despite these economic problems, accelerating growth in the world's most populous countries, China and India, helped sustain regional progress and kept global attention focused on economic growth in Asia through the 2000s, even though the growth and the international attention were largely concentrated in a different set of countries. However, new worries about Chinese economic growth have shaken global markets in recent years. Is China's growth miracle ending? How does the economic history of Asia's more advanced economies inform our view of the future economic prospects for India and China? In what ways are China and India pursuing a different path to economic development than that taken by their predecessors? How can investors, consumers, and producers in the United States benefit from continued Asian growth? What can U.S. policymakers do to support continued growth in the region and ensure that America continues to benefit from it? The economic future of billions of human beings depends quite significantly on the answers to these questions.","Learning Outcomes: This course is designed to provide future business leaders and policymakers with the essential knowledge necessary to evaluate economic opportunities and risks in Asia. The course will use analytical tools drawn from several fields of economics and finance, business cases, and guest lectures by outside experts to focus on the key strengths that sustained economic growth in Asia for decades, the weaknesses that undermined that growth in the late 1990s, and what lies ahead. Considerable attention will be paid to recent developments in India and China and the prospects for continued growth in these economies over the next decade. Students should emerge from this course with a well-developed understanding of the roots of Asian economic success, the current situation in the region, and likely economic scenarios for the short to medium run future. More importantly, students will acquire a 3 set of conceptual and analytical tools that they can use to understand the impact and significance of future developments in the region."
Management Science II: Decision and Risk Modeling,90760,6," This course, along with its companions (90-722 Management Science I: Decision and Risk Modeling, 94-833 Decision Analysis and Multi-Criteria Decision Making, and 95-760 Decision Making Under Uncertainty) are introductory courses in analytics and management science that survey a variety of hands-on quantitative and modeling methods useful to decision makers and analysts. 90-760 focuses on methods for making decisions in the face of uncertainty, including forecasting, Monte Carlo simulation, and queuing theory. Normally Heinz PPM, HCPM, MBTM, and MEIM students take 90-722 & 90-760, whereas MISM students take 95-760 which pulls examples from the information systems context. Both tracks feed into 94-833, although students with a strong quantitative background can take 94-833 in the first year; No pre-requisite of the other courses are actually a prerequisite for 94-833.","Learning Outcomes: These courses have four objectives, listed in order from least to most important. First, you should become as comfortable working with spreadsheets, spreadsheet tools, and various add-ins as you already should be with word processors. By the end of the course, firing up Excel to model and solve a quantitative problem should be second nature. This skill will be a significant asset on the job market and in your career. Second, you should learn about a variety of techniques, what they are capable of, and what their limitations are so that you can intelligently call upon management science specialists and consultants when the occasion arises. Third, you should acquire sufficient proficiency with some of the techniques that you can use them as an “end user modeler”. Fourth, you should learn how to approach, abstract, and analyze problems from a quantitative, analytical perspective. In short, you should be able to use the language and perspective of mathematical modeling. In most lectures we will work through a small “case” to help you connect the methods to a problem that is richer than the typical end of chapter problem. The course moves quickly; be careful not to fall behind. Unless I explicitly say otherwise, always read the assigned readings before the class in which they are discussed; failing to do so is the most common reason for failing the course."
Human Rights Conflicts & Development,90763,12," The course is organized around the premise that seventy-three percent of people living in poor countries have recently been, or are in a civil war (Collier, The Bottom Billion). As a result, the course will explore the deep connections between conflict and development because conflict happens largely in developing countries and because conflict interferes with the development process and with the capacity of countries to have a sustainable development model. This course will focus on the struggle that selected Latin American and African countries have had in achieving a satisfactory level of development and the negative impact of conflict on development. Conversely, we will examine why conflicts and the human rights abuses resulting from those conflicts happen mostly in countries at a low level of development. In brief, the course will examine: a) Development approaches pursued in Africa and Latin America, b) Civil wars that have taken place in those continents and the human rights abuses that took place during those conflicts. c) The role of international organizations, peacekeepers, and foreign aid have played in both the development process, during and after major conflicts. d) Lastly, we’ll look at the human rights abuses suffered by people in selected countries and the policies pursued to confront the abusers known as Transitional Justice Policies",
"Behavior, Experiments & Institutions: Insights on Economics of Development",90764,6," Traditional economic models have helped us understand a great deal about the process of economic development. Still, many nations remain mired in persistent poverty, low levels of economic growth, and underachievement on numerous measures of human-centered development. This mini will look at insights from randomized controlled trials and behavioral economics that may help us understand some of this persistence at the ""micro"" (individual and market) level. At the ""macro"" (economy-wide) level, we will explore and evaluate work on the importance of strong institutions as a precondition for sustained growth. To the extent time allows, we will attempt to contrast the insights from this work with those of traditional economic models in areas like trade, poverty, education, health, and finance.",
"Cities, Technology, and the Environment",90765,6," This mini will explore the interaction of cities, technology and the natural environment over time. More specifically, it will consider several major issues confronting cities today: (1) water supply, wastewater and storm water disposal and flooding; (2) Energy and Environment; (3) Transportation, suburbanization and land use; and (4) Brownfield creation and development. In a number of instances, the Pittsburgh region will be used to provide examples of these issues. These themes will be approached through a combination of class discussions, lectures, and visiting speakers. Class participation is expected, and will comprise a portion of the grade. Students will be expected to prepare a problem-oriented paper on one of the areas focused on in the course.",
Intermediate Database Design and SQL,90766,6," This course is designed to deepen a student’s knowledge and increase their skill in using relational database technology, with emphasis on the efficient use of advanced SQL to retrieve, analyze, and manipulate structured data. The course will expand on the basic relational database concepts and skills introduced in 90-728 by introducing advanced concepts and techniques for constructing logical and physical database designs. In addition, the course will introduce newer “big data” data models and contrast them with the relational data model. Students will gain experience in using Oracle’s Relational Database Management System throughout the course.","Learning Outcomes: After successfully completing the course, a student will be able to: 1) Use basic and advanced Structured Query Language (SQL) data manipulation constructs to retrieve, analyze, and manipulate enterprise data based on advanced data models and/or complex processing logic. 2) Apply knowledge of relational algebra, query execution, and performance tuning to analyze and tune SQL statements. 3) Utilize advanced data modeling concepts and techniques to create logical database designs that satisfy business and data integrity requirements. 4) Translate a simple logical database design into a physical database design. 5) Use SQL data definition constructs to create database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. 6) Contrast newer data models with the relational data model, identifying current uses of these data models. NOTE: All SQL work will be completed using Oracle 11g SQL. Students with an Apple computer must install Windows (Bootcamp/VM) in order to use the Oracle software. This software is not available in any campus computer labs."
AI for Public Policy,90769,None," With the rapid development of algorithmic and computing power as well as tech industry’s capacity to collect massive data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have increasingly become a ubiquitous part of our everyday lives, ranging from fields such as communication, healthcare, finance, policing and workplace management. Instead of studying AI as a purely technical subject, in this course, we will critically examine the most recent developments and deployments of AI from a social, cultural and policy perspective. Drawing upon real-world cases, this course will introduce students to the basic concepts and main topics to think AI socially, help them understand the potential benefits and pitfalls of various contemporary AI applications, and think toward future AI systems that can deliver greater social good.","Learning Outcomes: * Raise intellectual questions about the social, cultural and policy dimensions of AI in various social domains * Identify potential benefits and pitfalls (e.g. bias) in existing AI applications * Develop and deliver (both written and oral presentation) policy memos on AI systems that can yield greater societal benefits"
Public Expenditure Analysis,90774,12," The full description can be found here: http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rs9f/public_expenditure_analysis.pdf This is a companion course to Public Finance, 90-736, and is designed to deal with the expenditure side of the public sector budget in a series of modules. It has been conceptualized as a blending of private and public capital budgeting principles. The former provides a systematic framework, for the evaluation of private- sector projects, while the latter builds on the former, and introduces issues of externalities, shadow pricing, and the social rate of discount. The two courses, Public Finance and Public Expenditure Analysis, may be viewed as capstone courses for those Heinz students seeking careers in the public sector, or those parts of the private sector that routinely deal with the public sector. Students from across campus are welcome to enroll. The course is divided into 4 modules. In Module 1, the course develops the essential techniques of private sector evaluation principles. In Module 2, special problems which arise in the evaluation of public sector projects are discussed; a variety of evaluation techniques and applications especially suited to public sector projects are then examined. In Module 3, actual cost-benefit studies in the policy areas of education, environment, health, criminal justice, transportation and recreation are examined. In Module 4, evaluation at a high level of aggregation is dealt with through the use of generational accounting models. These models are examples of aggregate long and short-term public evaluation problem areas typically dealt with by national governments. Also in Module 4 groups of students perform and report a critical review of a cost-benefit study they have chosen. Throughout the course, similarities and differences between the public sector and private sector are emphasized, and examples from the real world are discussed in class. The course presumes that the student has had courses in microeconomics and economic statistics, owns a calculator capable of doing x^(a/b) or x^(1.36), and is familiar with the use of spreadsheet packages on a personal computer. Students are expected to bring their calculator to each class, and perform calculations in conjunction with class activities.",
Intermediate Statistical Methods,90777,6," This introductory course in data analysis and statistical inference requires no background in statistics. Its objective is to provide individuals who aspire to enter management or policy analysis positions with the basic statistical tools for analyzing and interpreting data. The course is divided into three distinct modules: descriptive statistics, statistical inference, and regression analysis. The emphasis of the classes on descriptive statistics is the calculation and interpretation of summary statistical measures for describing raw data. The sessions on statistical inference are designed to provide you with the background for executing and interpreting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The final component of the course focuses on regression analysis, a widely used statistical methodology. Throughout the course you will regularly analyze data relevant to management and policy analysis using the Excel statistical software package.",Learning Outcomes: -Apply statistical tools to analyze problems in IT and PP - Describe the merits and limitations of statistics to IT and PP applications - Characterize data with appropriate statistical tests - Use common statistical tools to answer problems quantitatively - Interpret statistical analyses - Appreciate the interpretation of statistical models as a source of knowledge to guide decision-making
Media And Public Policy,90778,6," This course will examine the influence of the media on public policy in the United States. During the mini, students will join the instructor in considering various explanations of how the news (and other activities of journalists) affects the policymaking process. This will involve exposure to the major themes of media influence in American politics. We will also consider the role of the media in elections, in public policy debates, and in public opinion formation. Through lots of readings, discussion, and expert guest visitors, we want to understand how the media influences American politics and policy, as well as why the media behaves the way it does. Working in teams, students will complete a project during the mini that involves drafting a “media strategy analysis” for some organization promoting a major policy issue of current importance.","Learning Outcomes: Students will leave the course with a better understanding of the role of the media in American public life, with practical experience in the analysis of news, with knowledge of the laws that affect the media, and with some sense of how to interact with journalists and media when participating in policy-making."
Multi-Media,90782,12," This course is about communication. Specifically, we will use various media elements (text, images, animation, video and sound) to form communicative units. The purpose of a multimedia piece is to communicate a message to the audience. The goal of this course is to use type, color, illustrations, images, sound, animation and video to produce professional materials. This course will teach a combination of graphic design skills and software skills. Students will also learn the terminology, procedures and production requirement to effectively communicate with ad agencies, design firms and commercial printers. Throughout the course students will learn the skills of the following applications: • Adobe InDesign CC • Adobe Illustrator CC • Adobe Photoshop CC • Apple Garageband • Adobe Animate (Flash) CC • Apple Final Cut Pro/Adobe Premiere Each of the above software programs will have one or two projects/assignments that will be completed by the student. These applications are available in the classroom as well as several public clusters. While the class offers a jump-start to these applications, students are expected to explore the higher level features on their own. Another resource is the Internet - which offers a wealth of tips and techniques for these applications.","Learning Outcomes: By the end of the class you will be able to... • Create professional multi-media material using a variety of Adobe/Apple software. • Be able to effectively communicate to your target audience using a variety of mutli-media programs. • Become familiar with media design principles. • Become familiar with graphic design/multi-media terminology. • Be able to effectively communicate with clients, design firms and media content professionals."
Policy Innovation Lab,90783,6," The Policy Innovation Lab is a new initiative that connects students with actual, current state-level policy challenges, and connects state-level policy makers with solutions to those challenges. This course is an experiment in improving public policy through by working outside the traditional structures of government. In order to be successful, this course will embrace a culture that expects and encourages rapid experimentation, a willingness to fail early in order to discover a solution that ultimately works, and a flat structure that provides students with an opportunity to deliver for our government partners. Students will work to solve pressing challenges by redefining the problem in terms of understanding the affected users of systems, conducting user-centered research, designing solutions, testing those same solutions, and iteratively improving those outcomes. This course is designed to take advantage of recent lessons learned in applied innovation in government entities around the world. The actual outcomes will be heavily dependent on both the needs of the problem sets for each course as well as the skills of the students. The course will apply some methodologies commonplace in industry like agile, design-thinking, and open source to deliver products and services that have the potential to live on beyond the course. For public-facing projects, work will be done in a transparent manner where possible in order to encourage external participation. Some examples of potential outcomes might include prototyping a service to match entrepreneurs with funding opportunities in government; a GIS-based web application to connect those looking for housing assistance programs with government services; or an economic impact analysis of a particular industry or sector.","Learning Outcomes: Course Objectives This course is intended to: 1. Enhance your awareness of the ubiquity and power of stories. 2. Increase your understanding of the role of storytelling in public life. 3. Improve your ability to use stories in designing, communicating and implementing policy. 4. Sharpen your storytelling skills and your ability to match stories to audiences and policy objectives. Approach Although—as we hope to demonstrate—the principles of this course are timeless, the idea of “political narrative” is of comparatively recent vintage. Consequently, there are no standard texts for the material we will cover. Students will be encouraged to question the premises of the course and expected to participate actively in classroom discussion.

Financing the Public Good,90788,6," From the earliest days of the republic to the present, government at all levels (federal, state and local) has invested in the physical and social infrastructure that underpins our now advanced and sophisticated economy. The resulting fiscal relationships have been controversial, with Washington spending trillions in grants and other assistance, but with conditions, or “strings” that state and local governments often find onerous and intrusive. Furthermore, federal budget deficits are now forcing political leaders in Washington to find ways to curtail spending, with many assistance programs potentially on the chopping block and states left to enforce federal standards with less money. This seminar examines the decisions political leaders must make to pay for the “public good.” Should highways, for example, be funded by users (through tolls), by vehicle owners (through a gasoline tax) or by all taxpayers (who benefit from highways even if they do not drive)? Should the federal government be forcing states to implement federal standards, like raising the drinking age as a condition for receiving federal highway funds? How will such developing technologies and behaviors as electric vehicles and ride sharing change the economics and politics of funding our transportation infrastructure? How can the federal government balance the budget without shortchanging vital national priorities? The seminar will focus on the tough choices policymakers face over taxation and spending at all levels of government through case studies that illustrate the issues. Students will develop briefing papers and lead class discussions that explore how federal, state and local interests can align or collide depending on the issue. The seminar encourages students to improve their decision making experience over complex issues of politics and government finance, and skillsets at analyzing and explaining policy issues in a debate setting.",
Sustainable Community Development,90789,12," This course examines past and current community development topics and trends associated with creating and/or maintaining sustainable communities. Such topics include sustainable development, creative capitalism, regional planning and visioning, governance, regional equitable development, sustainable business practices, green/clean tech, smart growth and smart transportation, carbon management, resource conservation, local living economies, energy systems and strategies, dynamics of neighborhoods, among other topics. Emphasis will fall on how these various dimensions need to strategically align to promote sustainable communities amidst their complexities. The class will also delve into a variety of green and sustainable development practices to provide frameworks for integrating traditional community development practices with sustainable development practices. The class takes lessons from the past (both what has worked and what did not work) as well as appropriate, current practices and explores how to apply them to a variety of community situations and conditions. The focus is on urban communities in the U.S and worldwide, both large and small. The course includes experiential, hands-on learning (projects, case studies, analyses, presentations,field trips, and guest lectures) as well as reflective components (readings, discussion, and papers).","Learning Outcomes: • Learn and deploy sustainable and green development practices and how to integrate these techniques into community development strategies; • Evaluate and design various public planning and policy initiatives on the formation of places; and • Engage with communities with appropriate processes and strategies to enhance their resilient capacities as they face environmental, economic, and social challenges."
Integrated Community Energy Systems,90793,12," Integrated community energy systems (ICESs) are an emerging strategy to meet local energy needs and to provide system services to the central grid, adding resilience to both systems. ICES integrate available environmental and technical resources and reflect the local socioeconomic and institutional context. Consequently, each ICES will be distinct and will reflect time-dependent local thermal and electrical energy requirements and the political appetite for local energy infrastructure. 48-761 (cross-listed with 90-793) is a new graduate class that examines the technical and environmental characteristics of existing ICES and the political and regulatory context that supports them. The class is designed to introduce students to the design and operation of ICES and to the impact of policy and regulation in facilitating or discouraging their creation. Globally, countries are seeking strategies to make energy infrastructure more robust and sustainable in the face of climate change and the demands of growing and developing populations. This course provides a focused look at integrated community systems as a promising approach to reshape our energy landscape. The course will focus on energy demands and supply in the built environment, although integration with the transportation and industrial sectors will be discussed within the context of existing case studies. Prerequisites: registering students should understand conventional energy infrastructure and applied thermal and electrical energy use within buildings. They should also have an appreciation for policy and regulation and the ability to read and understand regulatory language. The course is project based and students will apply what they learn in class to local projects. District energy system modeling will be introduced, although students are not required to master it. For their final projects, students can concentrate on either technical or policy/regulatory aspects of ICES since both are critical to their development.",
Environmental Policy And Planning,90798,12," Environmental Policy and Planning provides an introduction to how environmental policies have been and can be designed/created, implemented, and evaluated amidst complex information-based, social, political, and cultural processes. The course emphasizes a systems-based methodological approach for addressing the complexities involved in framing, analyzing, and designing an implementation plan for policy construction. The course also explores through landmark and contemporary case studies several dimensions of environmental policymaking: * Contextual, historical, and structural aspects of environmental policymaking at the local, state, federal, and international levels * Use of quantitative and qualitative analytical tools (from the core program as well as new tools) * The process of how policies derive their meaning. Students in this course work on a final environmental policy project to demonstrate mastery of the knowledge and skill-based exercises explored during the term.","Learning Outcomes: * Learn and deploy a systems-based approach towards structuring and analyzing an environmental policy decision situation * Connect several analytical tools to policymaking processes, such as rate and weight decision methods, optimization, decision analysis and decision trees, economic modeling, risk analysis, and GIS * Evaluate and design potential alternative policy solutions * Propose strategic ways of engaging with social and political processes in order to advance policy solution goals * Assess how the courses tools relate to career goals and objectives"

Public Policy Analytics: Cases and Issues,90802,6," How can an algorithm used to identify children at risk of mistreatment be hailed as a success in Pennsylvania, “useless” in New Zealand and the subject of legal action by citizens in Scotland? Are data techniques applied to the criminal justice systems prone to racial bias? What rights should citizens have over the dissemination and use of data collected on them by governments? What redress should citizens have when data anonymized by governments is re-identified? We all know that the same big data techniques applied successfully in the commercial world are being turned to use by governments. However, the relationship between governments and their citizens is vastly more complex than the relationship between companies and their existing and prospective customers. This course focuses on the management issues that arise for governments looking to big data applications for better performance. In taking this perspective it traverses the various levers available to governments such as legislation, administrative reform and participative democracy as well as the pitfalls. The ultimate aim is to develop sound understandings of the principles which public policy professionals using big data techniques can apply to achieve successful outcomes for both governments and their citizens. The course concludes with a critical examination of some contemporary issues emerging from the use of dig data in the public policy arena such as perceptions of disempowerments and assertions of accountability deficits.",

Public Private Partnerships I: Theory and Design,90814,6," Both governments and the private sector continue to grow their knowhow in using Public Private Partnerships (PPP's) for providing infrastructure. The result is the creation of a substantial body of research and theory on both the method and management of these projects. Much of it is based on successes as well as the lessons learned from projects that experienced problems and some that just plain failed. This accumulated knowledge provides students with the opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of the successes and failures so they and the governments they serve can learn from the experiences of others, avoiding the need to learn about the pitfalls the hard way. Carnegie Mellon University Australia has designed two, complementary courses to give students a comprehensive understanding of both PPP theory and the successful delivery and management of PPP projects. The courses draw upon both established theory as well as case studies. The content also focuses on developing management skills specific to the area of PPP's, particularly the successful execution of PPPs in the context of developing countries.",
Education Finance and Policy,90817,12," The purpose of this Heinz course is to introduce professional master’s students to the special problems of financing regional governments in a decentralized federal system with a special focus on public education. The course i] reviews theories of federalism from economic and constitutional perspectives, ii] reviews the evolution of the United States from a confederation to a federation, iii] examines financial and political problems associated with jointure, iv] reviews alternative rationales for public financing and provision of education (k-16), v] analyzes distressed school systems and municipal governments, vi] reviews the international evidence on estimated economic returns and distributional effects of k-16 public education and the use of cost-effectiveness and educational production functions, vii] school budgeting issues, viii] the school property tax, ix] intergovernmental relations and the design of school aid formulas, and x] the measurement and implications of student achievement. These issues are examined from positive and normative perspectives, and through the lens of economics and political economy. Students taking the course are expected to be conversant in basic statistics and its application on a micro-computer, know something about financial accounting or at least have an interest in it, have had an introductory course in micro-economics, and able to apply statistics and economics to real world problem sets that involve the manipulation of data and administrative records. Students who have had Public Finance will find taking the course more natural because the issues of the proper role of government in a market or mixed economy, the effects of different kinds of taxation on the distribution of income and wealth, and on economic efficiency will be more familiar. Students who have not had Public Finance will likely find it necessary to fill in gaps in their background as the course proceeds, and may have to do supplemental reading. Most required reading will be stored on Blackboard under Notes and Reading Materials, and questions to be discussed in class that pertain to the required reading will also be stored on Blackboard in the same folder. The course is organized into a series of topical sessions, and will be conducted on a lecture-discussion basis. Students are expected to have read the required reading before class. Students are also expected to own and know how to operate an electronic calculator (other than those contained in a cell phone*) that is capable of doing x^(a/b). Please be sure you bring such a calculator with you to class each session, bring your Strauss Bucks** to each session as well, and your answers to course session questions. Generally, students will find that reading the required readings and answering the questions to be discussed at hand will enhance their understanding of the materials to be read. Also, because the midterm and final exams will be based on the questions to be discussed, keeping track of the reading and questions to be discussed will materially aid in the preparation for the two exams. Students are expected to purchase themselves from an online or non-campus bookstore, a paperback version of The Federalist Papers. For example, a Signet Press version of this classic is available from Amazon.com for $7.95 plus shipping. Whether or not other required readings from various sources will entail other book purchases has not yet been determined. * Thanks to Christine Alagara for pointing this out in class several years ago. ** See http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rs9f/pf04.html.",

Critical Analysis of Policy Research,90822,6," This course prepares students to understand, interpret, and critique existing policy research. The course focuses on the development of three essential skills for policy analysts: 1) Read and interpret empirical results in published research. 2) Understand the assumptions needed to infer causal relationships and assess their plausibility. 3) Recognize common problems in policy research, including reverse causality, omitted variables, measurement error, etc., and use graphical methods to determine the direction of the resulting statistical bias. Using these three skills, students will practice understanding and critiquing policy research. Moreover, by identifying and understanding potential problems, students can make valid conclusions even from seriously flawed research. At the end of the class, students demonstrate these skills by independently evaluating an existing piece of research of their choice, presenting their findings in a written report and in-class presentation.","Learning Outcomes: 1) Read and interpret empirical results in published research. 2) Understand the assumptions needed to infer causal relationships and assess their plausibility. 3) Recognize common problems in policy research, including reverse causality, omitted variables, measurement error, etc., and use graphical methods to determine the direction of the resulting statistical bias."
Program Evaluation,90823,12," Pre-Requisite(s): 90-711 or 90-786. In all parts of the world, from the local to the global level, governments, funding agencies, organizations, and individuals are involved in activities meant to improve some aspect of people’s lives – disaster relief in Haiti, human rights work in Sierra Leone, increasing school attendance in Detroit or improving outcomes for IV drug users in Barcelona, the list is long and ever changing. The needs addressed by these programs are often compelling and the programs themselves can be innovative, practical, and inspired. From those running and funding social programs to those whose needs are meant to be addressed by these programs a central question arises: Does this social program work? In this course you will learn how to gather and synthesize evidence to address this question. Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the program's design and implementation, and ultimately the program’s impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the program’s merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making. Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading. This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation. Students will be taught how to conduct basic program evaluations as well as how to critique and monitor more comprehensive program evaluations. Successful completion of this course will prepare students to be contributing members of teams that design and carry out program evaluations or that commission program evaluations and make decisions based upon their results.","Learning Outcomes: • Be a valuable member of an evaluation team, able to contribute to both planning and execution, while having a solid foundation on which to build. • Be an informed consumer of program evaluations, and assist governments, agencies or funding organizations in making decisions based on evaluations. • Differentiate between strengths, limitations, and weaknesses of an evaluation and of a program, and communicate those distinctions clearly. • Understand the methods and concepts introduced in the course, AND be able to explain them clearly, in plain language, to diverse stakeholders with diverse backgrounds. • Identify when each method for evidence gathering and analysis would be appropriate or inappropriate, and defend those assessments. • Explain to a newly elected official how to best think about assessing government programs."
Cost Benefit Analysis,90824,6," Individuals and organizations are frequently presented with decisions about how best to allocate limited resources. Public organizations in particular have an obligation to use consistent and transparent analytic tools to inform tradeoffs among competing policy priorities such as the environment, health, safety, and security. Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms. Such challenges include determining how to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately characterizing uncertainty. The ability to assess key assumptions and limitations is critical for both producers and consumers of cost-benefit analysis. Prerequisites Students must have completed EITHER 90-709 Intermediate Economic Analysis OR 90-710 Applied Economic Analysis, as well as 90-711 Empirical Methods.","Learning Outcomes: Through lectures, discussions, readings, problem sets, written assignments, and presentations, students will develop knowledge and skills that will enable them to: • Apply the analytic tools and techniques of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics in the formulation and assessment of real-world policies. • Contribute to the development of defensible and transparent cost-benefit analyses. • Understand and identify the assumptions and limitations of cost-benefit analyses. • Critically assess cost-benefit analyses conducted by others. • Evaluate and compare alternative policies using the tools of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics. • Communicate the results of the cost-benefit analysis to stakeholders in such a way as to facilitate political or administrative processes."

Health Policy and Management Systems,90836,6," Health Systems is a foundation course intended to introduce students to many of the broad subjects that will be detailed in more advanced course work. This introduction provides a framework to aid students in navigating from public policy through to healthcare delivery. Public policy is the study of the written and unwritten principles on which law is based. Laws and regulations translate policy into action. Public policy and laws form the basis of health policy. Health policy is supported by: - Public health initiatives focused on preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health for the entire population. (i.e. diabetes awareness) - Population health is interested in the outcomes of individual groups and the distribution of outcomes among the groups. (i.e. income equality and infant mortality) - Healthcare delivery is focused on access, quality and cost. At this time in our history, Healthcare Reform best embodies the intent of this aspect of health policy. Through the use of group assignments, students will create a model which links external environment into healthcare delivery profitability. Modeling is a form of combining individual technical components with the greater knowledge and conceptualization of the entire process. Its promise is to promote better decision making by envisioning how micro decisions interconnect to mission, goals and outcomes. Utilizing the two textbook books, students will gain an understanding of the topics of health policy, public health, population health and healthcare delivery.","Learning Outcomes: At the conclusion of the course, students will be able to: - Navigate the basic structures of the U.S. government - Identify the government agencies involved in the U.S. Health Care system - Identify U.S. Code of Law (COL) associated with the Health Care System - Identify U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) that codifies the COL - Perform a PEST Analysis to determine the effectiveness of COL to CFR translation - Identify the structural components and business model of the U.S. Healthcare Delivery System - Develop a Provider Model to obtain a basic understanding of how disease translates into revenue and cost"
Global Health Security,90839,3," This “micro-mini” course serves as an introduction to global health security and its intricate links to international relations and international development. With the accelerating interconnectedness between societies and economies, new forms of health security threats are arising, and nations are investing more in mutual preparedness and conducting new forms of “soft power” diplomacy to mitigate those risks. In recent years, the field has expanded greatly with governments, companies and NGOs investing more resources and efforts across many sectors. Due to limited time, this micro- mini can only highlight selected threat categories. The primary focus will be the “3-D threats” of Disaster, Disease, and Disorder, with complex humanitarian crises showcasing the latter threat. To illustrate factors at work, time will be devoted to “deep dives” using case studies and readings on prominent events. The course will serve as an active “policy laboratory” in which your ideas are catalyzed and then shaped with the participation of your cohort. Useful frameworks will be employed to simplify the dynamics within complex situations, and to organize your thinking about actions and options. Activating these skills will embed your ability to think more clearly about policy domains, strategic goals, and implementation. The course welcomes all learners from a wide range of knowledge, from the novice to the experienced. The course relies on active participation that feeds a mutual learning environment and that catalyzes and reveals students’ ideas as they occur, thereby fostering an at-the-ready style of nimble thinking and conversing.",
Public Policy Implementation,90842,6," Presidents, governors, legislators, elected officials, and judges have issued orders, passed laws, approved policies, and set goals for hundreds of years. But approving or legislating the most enlightened public policy or program does not guarantee that it will be implemented in an effective way -- or even in the way intended by the policy maker. Rarely are the people who make public policy decisions the ones who implement those decisions. In a democratic government, saying it is does not make it so! This course is designed to study, review, and analyze policy implementation in the public sector. This is a look at government bureaucracy, and how to improve policy implementation in the 21st Century! In a democratic society, how does one effectively get from the declaration of a policy to its implementation, particularly when implementation has been such a low priority for our elected officials? Implementation involves the complex interactions of many elements: translating ideas into workable programs; making decisions for both program design and operation; communicating with both constituencies and affected decision-makers; overcoming the resistance of bureaucrats; and assessing and evaluating the results. Examples of programs and policies will be used throughout the course. Each student, as a member of a team, will develop an implementation plan for a selected policy or program. The course will also involve lots of reading that highlight implementation issues.","Learning Outcomes: This course is designed to help the student understand and appreciate the critical issues involved in the implementation of public policy and programs. Sadly, public policy implementation has not been a popular field of study, despite its importance to the success or failure of public decisions. The lack of understanding of policy implementation may help explain public frustration with government in general. This course will help the student of public affairs recognize the key factors that turn policy decisions into positive reality."
Unlocking the Development Finance Toolbox to Support Sustainable Econ Dev,90843,3," Economic development is driven largely by funding and financing opportunities. Nearly every redevelopment, business expansion, community facility and infrastructure project hinges on the availability of affordable, patient and flexible capital. When addressing sustainability in economic development, funding and finance are even more critical. The lack of funding and finance can result in the ability for projects and programs to move forward in an effective manner. From the bedrock tools like bonds and targeted tool like tax increment to tax credit investment and access to capital lending programs, the development finance toolbox provides financing options that cover the entire development continuum. Unlocking the Development Finance Toolbox to Support Sustainable Economic Development will explore the intersection of development, sustainability and finance with an in depth review of the financing tools that catalyze and drive job growth and economic expansion. This course will not only explore the tools behind effective development but also examine success projects and programs that are driving communities towards a sustainable future.","Learning Outcomes: Learn the fundamentals of development finance and the tools used in communities. Describe and define terminology specific to development finance tools. Compare approaches to tool implementation. Critique and evaluate tool use for most desirable outcomes. Identify, describe and explain different positions/perspectives in the use of development finance tools. Articulate in written form your reflections on maximizing the development finance tools available to communities."
Entrepreneurship and Business Plan Development,90845,12," How do new companies get started? How do existing businesses convert new ideas into ventures that enhance (or even fundamentally change) their mission and objectives? Why is it important to nurture a new business idea and give it a fair chance of succeeding by creating a solid business plan? What is a business plan, anyway, and how do you create one? Who is the audience for your business plan? How do you present a business plan to key decision makers and other stakeholders? This course, organized into three distinct modules, is designed to answer these kinds of questions and many more: • Introduction to Entrepreneurship and Business Plan Development provides an overview of new venture planning and how to create an effective plan (in-person); • Business Plan Development is dedicated to actual business plan formulation (online / virtual activities); and • Business Plan Presentation focuses on developing a compelling and effective approach to describing a new venture (in-person). In Introduction to Entrepreneurship and Business Plan Development, we’ll cover a variety of topics including: • Conceiving a viable venture • Determining whether the idea is entrepreneurial or intrapreneurial • Evaluating the opportunity • Validating the opportunity through market research • Conducting competitive analysis • Understanding competitive barriers • Initiating a marketing strategy • Putting the right management team in place • Creating a financial model • Outlining the necessary milestones for successful implementation The foundational topics covered in this module (which can help you start almost anything!) will get you ready to develop a comprehensive business plan in a series of steps from a project summary to a “Business Model Canvas” to a first draft through to the finished product – “The Plan” – and a presentation to excite and elicit support from those who matter.","Learning Outcomes: 1. Provide a step-by-step introduction to the concepts needed to “ideate” a new business, prepare a compelling plan, arrange for capitalization, and launch an impactful new venture. 2. Obtain the basic knowledge and language needed to participate effectively in discussions and negotiations, and ask the right questions of investors, customers, and stakeholders. 3. Get you excited about embarking on a journey to more deeply consider the opportunity you have to launch a financially viable venture, either as a separate concern or part of an existing organization, which addresses an unmet market need."
Grand Corruption and Rule of Law,90847,6," This course will address the implementation challenges facing international anti-corruption agreements, notably the UN Convention against Corruption and the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. Getting signatory countries' laws and regulations to be consonant with the provisions of these conventions is only the first stage of what is, in fact, a two-stage implementation process. The second stage is the enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations. This stage, which fosters deterrence and strengthens the rule of law vital to economic development, will be the focus of the course. The course will examine cases of grand corruption across the world, including in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Among the countries to be covered will be the US, China, Russia, Brazil, India, South Africa, Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and others. The course will discuss different strategies and solutions that leaders in governments, non-government organisations and private sector can consider to improve, at a global level, the implementation of UNCAC and OECD anti-bribery convention. At the national level, the course will discuss and develop recommendations to enhance the enforcement of anti-corruption laws in terms of effective detection, investigation, prosecution and sanctions against corruption, with due consideration to different country contexts.",
Societal Consequences of Technological Change: Education,90850,3," Course will meet on: February 2 & 3, 2019 in HBH 1206. This ""micro class"" is a two-day dive into the future of K-12 education, a $600 billion industry in the U.S. affecting the lives of over 55 million children every year. The class focuses on the intersection of education and technology, and its implications for the future of how we teach, learn, and live. Students will learn about the promise of ""personalization"", a big idea with the potential to change the management model that has organized schooling for more than a century. They'll be exposed to research and reform efforts, including some happening here at CMU, to apply technology and cognitive learning to improve how we teach and learn, and to anticipate ways technology could facilitate new ways of organizing the experience of school. Then they'll unpack these ideas to identify future scenarios, their implications, and anticipate how the benefits and costs would likely be distributed. Participants will identify actions that could be taken to improve the potential effect on the human condition, mitigating the risks and maximizing the benefits across many stakeholders, including those who have been historically marginalized and disadvantaged. As part of the experience, students will be challenged to apply the skills they are learning in their courses, and will experience facilitation techniques they are likely to find useful in their own careers, whatever field they ultimately pursue. The course will meet for two fun and intense days - February 2 and 3, 2019. The grade will be based on participation (including peer feedback and self-reflection) and assignments completed during the two days as well as pre-work leading up to the experience and afterwards to complete the group project and bring closure to the learning.",
High Reliability in Healthcare,90852,6," Health care in the United States is largely delivered in systems of care that are complex, inefficient, error prone, and costly. There currently exists a high degree of variability in the delivery of care between providers and settings of care. Other industries outside of health care have been successful at reducing inefficiencies and eliminating waste through the standardization of processes. This course will provide students with insight into the unique aspects of the health care environment and the necessary skills to successfully facilitate change, engage administrators and frontline staff. The course will explore elements of highly reliable organizations, culture of safety in the healthcare environment, the evolving science of quality improvement, and the use of clinical pathways to drive high-value health care. This course will prepare students to strategize organizational movement, and to identify solutions to overcome complex challenges such as cultural barriers, changing economic and market structures, and evolving technology. Didactics and case studies will be blended into the environment for team discussion. The students will collaborate to consider how they could solve challenging, real-life cases. They will develop a plan for implementation, and process/outcome measures.",Learning Outcomes: 1. Develop an understanding of health care quality and culture of safety 2. Recognize characteristics of highly reliable organizations 3. Determine the opportunities and challenges of health information technology 4. Identify areas for improvement and apply methodologies to reduce variation and inefficiencies.
Understanding and Preventing Corruption K2,90859,None," With the World Bank estimating that globally about $1 trillion per year is paid in bribes, and that this illegality leads to poor economic performance and human rights violations, this course examines the phenomenon of corruption, identifies the contexts within which it flourishes, explores means of measuring it, and analyses the opportunity structure for corruption. The course also touches on corruption control, and pathways to prevention.","Learning Outcomes: At the end of this module students will be able to 1. Describe different concepts, definitions and measures of corruption 2. Illustrate corrupt behaviour with specific examples 3. Analyse types of corruption in different settings 4. Move beyond description of corruption to strategic analysis for intervention or prevention"
Policy in a Global Economy,90860,6, As global economic integration reaches historically unprecedented levels international trade exerts an ever greater influence on national economies. In this environment international trade affects the challenges faced by nearly all policy makers and managers including those addressing poverty growth development labor inequality and the environment. This course provides policy makers and managers with the knowledge and analytical tools necessary to understand international trading relationships and their effects. These issues will be studied using the analytical tools and concepts of international economics. Case studies will be used to implement these concepts in practice.,
Health Policy,90861,6," This course introduces students to the concepts, theories, and tools of health policy. The aims of this course are to provide students with (1) the ability to identify key problems facing the United States health system, (2) increase the appreciation for and understanding of health policy as an important and useful tool for enhancing population health, and (3) mechanisms to address a current health policy issue from legal, economic, behavioral, and political perspectives. In addition, students will be introduced to a cross-national comparison of health systems. Prerequisites: 90-836 Health Systems 6 Units","Learning Outcomes: • Understand critical issues facing the U.S. health system • Define health policy problems and assess alternative solutions • Analyze a range of contemporary health policies from legal, economic, behavioral, and political perspectives • Describe the role of interest groups and public opinion in health policy issues • Describe the United States health care system and compare it to others • Present and defend solutions to health policy problems • Prepare clear and concise policy papers"
Policy and Leadership in Public Education,90865,6," This course introduces students to policy issues in public education while simultaneously building the skills to lead change through authentic assignments and in-class collaboration. The course addresses both the ""what"" and the ""how"" of leading policy change, combining content presentation and discussion with an iterative approach to each assignment. The content of the course will consist of four parts: 1) the basics of education policy, looking at different perspectives about the purpose of schooling and the history, structure, funding and current state of public education in the United States, 2) contemporary issues, exploring relevant topics in education policy today, 3) leading change and what it takes to be a successful leader in the field, how to manage change, and the many career pathways available in public education, and 4) contemplating the future of education, exploring possibilities for transforming how students learn, and considering potential changes to the system that could impact the outcomes it yields.",
Large Scale Data Analysis for Public Policy,90866,6," The past decade has seen the increasing availability of very large scale data sets, arising from the rapid growth of transformative technologies such as the Internet and cellular telephones, along with the development of new and powerful computational methods to analyze such datasets. Such methods, developed in the closely related fields of machine learning, data mining, and artificial intelligence, provide a powerful set of tools for intelligent problem-solving and data-driven policy analysis. These methods have the potential to dramatically improve the public welfare by guiding policy decisions and interventions, and their incorporation into intelligent information systems will improve public services in domains ranging from medicine and public health to law enforcement and security. This course will provide a basic introduction to large scale data analysis methods, focusing on three main problem paradigms (prediction, modeling, and detection). Students will learn how to translate policy questions into these paradigms, choose and apply the appropriate intelligence and machine learning tools, and correctly interpret, evaluate, and apply the results for policy analysis and decision making. We will emphasize tools that can ""scale up"" to real-world policy problems involving reasoning in complex and uncertain environments, discovering new and useful patterns, and drawing inferences from large amounts of structured, high-dimensional, and multivariate data. No previous knowledge of artificial intelligence or machine learning is required.","Learning Outcomes: - Identify large scale data analysis methods, focusing on three main problem paradigms: prediction, modeling, and detection. - Translate policy questions into paradigms. - Choose and apply the appropriate artificial intelligence and machine learning tools. - Interpret, evaluate, and apply the results for policy analysis and decision making."
Special Topics: New Technology Commercialization: Public Policy Strategies,90869,6," During this project-based class, students will develop non-market strategies for real-world clients. As defined, by David Baron, “The nonmarket environment consists of the social, political, and legal arrangements that structure interactions among companies and their public.” This class will focus on non-market strategies at the intersection of new technologies, public policies, and business. Entrepreneurs and innovators interested in commercializing technology in the biomedical, energy, transportation, information technology, robotics, aerospace, food, healthcare, and other industries require more than knowing whether a technology works and the potential market. Non-market factors such as regulations, standards, and grants influence product, price, location, research, development, and testing, and other decisions. As a result, public policies provide both opportunities and challenges for the commercialization of an invention. Only by recognizing these opportunities or overcoming these challenges can an invention become a commercialized innovation.",
Using R for Policy Data Analysis,90872,6," Data analysis is an essential part of quantitative policy analysis; however, focused application of statistical methods is beyond the scope of what can be taught in classes such as Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Program Evaluation. In this course, students who have completed CBA and Program Evaluation will apply a variety of data analysis techniques using R, a free open source statistics and graphical analysis environment that is increasingly used by data miners and analysts. Class sessions will include a combination of instruction on data analysis techniques, in-class application using R, and critical evaluation and discussion of published CBA and Program Evaluation cases. Applications will focus on analyses that support the execution of CBA and Program Evaluation, including cases that focus on consumer protection, affordable housing, and public health.","Learning Outcomes: • Using microdata to estimate the size of a population impacted by a policy or program. • Estimating the per-unit impact of a policy change or program implementation. • Understanding the demographics of impacted populations, including demonstrating which populations are disproportionately impacted. • Accounting for uncertainty for sensitivity analysis. • Import data into R data structures and check for missing data • Produce scatterplots, histograms, boxplots and other graphs to identify data problems and test data assumptions (e.g. normality, linearity). • Produce descriptive statistics, including mean, median, mode, proportion, standard deviation and other measures of central tendency and dispersion. • Calculate confidence intervals. Conduct t-test for differences in sample means and chi-square test to test for differences in categorical variables across groups. • Conduct bivariate correlation and simple regression analysis."
Special Topics: Principles & Practices of R&D Management,90874,6," This course considers key issues and trade-off in R&D strategy and organization, paying attention to dynamic competitive contexts where technology plays a key role. These topics are treated assuming the perspective of the decision maker. It addresses typical problems of large, medium and small firms having a structured R&D and operating businesses where R&D is the source of competitive advantages. Although we will heavily focus on R&D, emphasis is placed on viewing R&D as a part (although, a key part) of the process of technological innovation; therefore, as an activity to be strongly and appropriately integrated with other functions to make innovation successful.",
Healthcare Marketing,90877,6," Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value. In this course, students will gain a perspective on how the function of marketing links within an overall business system. The components of a marketing plan, the strategic plan, the brand plan and the business plan are detailed. Utilizing the textbook “Health Care Marketing – Tools and Techniques”, the student will gain an understanding of specific tools and techniques healthcare marketers use to gaining understanding. Past students have commented that working knowledge of these tools was of great benefit during job interviews. Healthcare is one of the most complex and highly regulated markets in the world. A simulation an industry team will demonstrate the student’s ability to navigate the healthcare value chain and think critically to create a winning strategy.","Learning Outcomes: Establishing a Marketing and Branding Plan within a real organization requires students to apply theory to a real-world situation. Like their real-world counterparts, student sub-teams will simultaneously be required to collaborate with each other while also focused on a customer objective. Project updates are due weekly so student progress is tested and marketing skills are under the watchful eye of a training coach. Students learn about all aspects of little “m” and big “M” by following the life cycle of a new software and service line and reacting to the marketplace. As big “M” requires a total view of the organization, teamwork among marketing with other functions is critical. This project promotes better decision making by helping the student see how marketing decisions are interconnected and must be managed as a whole. Students are faced with the pressures of delivering their project within a time line while simultaneously needing to deliver customer value to VERC."
Behavioral Economics in Public Policy,90882,12," Economics has up to now been the social science that has been most broadly and deeply involved in public policy. With its rational choice perspective, the economic perspective has tended to favor certain types of policies – namely those that enhance the efficiency of market mechanisms and lower the cost of information. In this course we will examine an alternative approach to public policy informed by behavioral economics, which integrates insights and research findings from economics and psychology to form a richer conception of human motivation and behavior. Behavioral economics both recognizes that sometimes people behave less than optimally – indeed, sometimes self-destructively – and draws on its understanding of why to propose alternative approaches to public policy. The course will begin with overviews of behavioral economics and ‘asymmetric paternalism’ (a uniquely behavioral economics approach to public policy), and then will focus in on specific public policy issues, including health, obesity, saving, crime and drug abuse. Each of these topics could (and often does) occupy a whole course, but we will be spending a week on each at the most. So coverage will necessarily be highly selective. This is the sixth time I’ve taught this course. In an effort to remain up to date I’ve included among topics to be discussed what I view as the three most important policy-related issues of our times: income inequality, climate change and the changing nature of work as a result of the proliferation of robots and artificial intelligence. Pre-requisites: Microeconomics (at least undergraduate-level) Statistics (including at least basic multiple regression)",Learning Outcomes: The goals of the course are to: - learn what classic economic assumptions behavioral economics challenges - gain a broad understanding of many of the issues facing policy makers - learn how BE has been applied in various policy domains and where it has been successful - apply basic knowledge of experimental design and principles of BE in order to assess existing policies - understand how to generate policy interventions using insights from BE
Data Visualization and Dashboards,90885,6," This course is designed to introduce data visualization as an analytical tool, a medium of communication, and the basis for interactive information dashboards. Students will learn best practices in data visualization, sharpen analytical skills, and learn how to design dashboards for use by stakeholders. Students will have the opportunity to practice skills with concrete deliverables, and will synthesize course material in a comprehensive team-based final project. This project will reinforce comfort with the Tableau software package and will provide a portfolio item for students. Students will use Tableau as their main tool to visualize data and develop dashboards but will develop transferrable skills which can apply to many of the most popular software packages in the current marketplace.","Learning Outcomes: At the end of the course, students will be able to: • Employ best practices in data visualization to develop charts, maps, tables, and other visual representations of data. • Use Tableau’s visualization tools to conduct data analysis, especially exploration of an unfamiliar dataset. • Use Tableau’s “Story Point” feature to connect visualizations for communication • Create compelling, interactive dashboards to combine several visualizations into a cohesive and functional whole. • Utilize advanced Tableau features including parameters, data blending, custom SQL, very large datasets, custom date hierarchies, and others. • Use data visualizations, dashboards, and Tableau Stories to support relevant communication for diverse audiences."
Public Policy & Decision Making,90886,6," This course will explore how to conduct complex (and concise) policy analysis that can be used to inform decision-makers, using the prism of policy analysis for Congress. The first part of the course will focus on the roles, interests, and operations of Congress and how it fits into the variety of governmental organizational settings. The class will then focus on learning how to develop non-partisan policy analysis on complex public policy issues. The first case study will be the use of contractors to support military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Students will then pick a public policy topic of their choosing and develop analytical products on their chosen topic.","Learning Outcomes: This course has three objectives: 1. To understand the role and interests of Congress and how Congress operates within the public policy process; 2. To learn how to conduct complex public policy analysis (taking into consideration legal, social, political, policy and other considerations); and 3. To learn how to transition from research and analysis to conceptualizing and developing new legislation and public policy including the regulatory process."
Apprenticeship Workshop,90888,3," The Washington Seminar is designed to assist students in getting the most out of their DC experience, specifically focused on helping the student succeed in their Apprenticeship and DC classes and be poised to effectively launch their career in Washington. The class will include: • Workshops and events that will introduce the student to a variety of career development tools and training sessions to support their professional growth; • Group discussions and interactive activities designed to develop a stronger understanding of Washington DC organizations and their role in the public good; and • Mentoring/coaching of students in individual and group settings to help them work through issues or problems as they arise.","Learning Outcomes: 1. Students will learn a variety of tools for professional growth and will be given the opportunity to put them into practice during the current year. Sessions will focus on developing your personal strengths, managing up, giving/receiving feedback, mentoring, project management and other topics as identified by the students and facilitators throughout the year. Students should be able to understand what these concepts are about and practice them throughout the year through their apprenticeships and DC courses. 2. Through group conversations, students will develop an understanding of Washington DC organizations and their role in supporting the public good and the policy making process. Students will be required to talk about their Apprenticeship organizations and how it fits into the larger Washington community."
Policy Topics: Environmental Policy,90893,6," This class will challenge students to the consider and evaluate current environmental problems using different policy frameworks. Students will explore approaches from both environmental economics and policy, including regulatory, market-based, and voluntary tools. Students will apply their knowledge of cost-benefit analysis to controversial issues and discover and debate key challenges. The current issues will draw students to consider issues of governance, such as the reach of executive authority and the relationship between federal and state government. In exploring these matters of policy design and environmental management, the course will analyze issues in climate change, air quality, water policy, energy supply, and resource management.","Learning Outcomes: Apply critical thinking and policy evaluation skills to current environmental regulatory problems. - Policy Brief, Final Exam, Class Participation Analyze complexities of establishing relevant performance measures. - Policy Brief, Final Exam, Class Participation Evaluate the limits and opportunities for integrating scientific and technical information into decision making. - Policy Brief, Final Exam, Class Participation Articulate in oral and written form policies to build a sustainable future. - Policy Brief, Final Exam, Class Participation"
Policy Topics I: Federal Budget Policy,90894,6," Why do we have such large budget deficits? Why does Congress have such a hard time agreeing on budget policy? Why is there such pork barrel spending and government waste in Washington? The answers to these questions, and others like them, require a detailed knowledge of the law and politics that lie behind the budget process, and the difficult policy choices that make up that process each year. This course proceeds simultaneously along two tracks. Track I will cover the law and procedures you need to understand how the federal budget is formulated and acted upon. This sounds dull, but it isn’t! For good reason, people call Congress the world’s greatest soap opera; and the budget process, while complex, is full of political warfare, the clashing of egos, and the constant pressure of voter demands. Those who know the law and procedures can gain an advantage over others in the struggle for dollars and the way they get spent. Track II will introduce you in some of the important budget issues that have made life so difficult for Republicans and Democrats alike: working out an effective budget process, balancing the budget, funding budget priorities with limited resources, and deciding how much (and how) to tax workers and investors. When we are working on Track II, you will develop “two-pagers,” the kinds of memoranda and statements written by congressional staff and political advisers. For a better grasp of budget policy than an eight-week course would normally allow, this seminar will also assign two-person teams to investigate selected advanced budget issues (e.g., highway funding, defense procurement). Team members will report back to the seminar with their findings and recommendations, and field questions from the rest of the seminar in a hearing-like setting.","Learning Outcomes: The overall objective of the course is to introduce you to the concepts and procedures that the players in the federal budget and appropriations process need to know. Because virtually all other policy areas (e.g., health care, environment, defense) have a budget component, and because State budgets depend so heavily on developments in Washington, you will be encouraged to bring your experience from other seminars and job postings into this course. Specific objectives are: • Identify and explain concepts and players that are central to the federal budget process and budget policy. • Identify and explain the legal and regulatory underpinnings of the budget process. • Identify and explain the constitutional basis for the ""power of the purse"" and other budget-related powers granted to Congress and the president. • Identify and explain major budget-related issues in their political, economic and legal context. • Familiarize oneself with the basic documents that make up the federal budget, and how to find information within those documents. • Articulate in oral and written form the arguments used by political leaders regarding select budget issues. • Utilize one's knowledge of budget policy to develop advisory material for a Member of Congress, political appointee, lobbyist, etc."
Policy Topics: Sustainable Development,90896,6," This course is taught from the point of view of the policy entrepreneur faced with developing policy on international development in an environment of competing priorities and paradigms, complex problems, diverse constituents, and multiple international stakeholders. The perspective of four different actors will be highlighted throughout the course: US Government; non-governmental organization; developing country; and multilateral institution. Students will learn analytic frameworks to hone their skill in two distinct components of policymaking: crafting sound policies and mastering the policy process. The course readings and guest lectures will provide insight and a realistic grounding in how to operate most effectively in the fluid and fastpaced global policy environment, and provide lessons on how to navigate and prevail in the highly contentious and charged policy debates surrounding international development. This course will not delve deeply into the equally challenging area of policy implementation, though suggested readings are provided. The course presumes no previous knowledge or experience in international development and does not attempt to provide a comprehensive review of the theoretical literature in the international development field.","Learning Outcomes: Upon completion of the course, the student will have: (1) a much broader and deeper understanding of global development issues and stakeholders after exploring the history, landscape and current challenges; (2) analytical skills to more effectively serve as an effective policy-maker which will be deepened as we examine development issues, particularly as they emerge in the media; and (3) tools to engage as a global citizen, building on your PPM training while focusing on the use of science, technology, innovation and partnership. Attainment of these course objectives will be assessed through class participation, a policy memo and a team project."
Ph.D. Seminar I,90901,12," This seminar is intended for all first-year PhD students in the Heinz College to introduce the research process and bring first-year students into the intellectual community at Heinz. The seminar includes presentations by Heinz College faculty, student presentations of existing research, and presentations from second-year Heinz College students. Through these experiences, students will • Become familiar with the kinds of research being done at Heinz • Find faculty and students with similar research interests • Understand the unseen steps (and missteps) along the way to a published paper • Experience presenting technical research to a diverse audience • Learn to provide helpful feedback on research presentations",Learning Outcomes: Explore a diversity of approaches to research and use those to develop a strong research proposal.
Ph.D. Seminar II,90902,12," Students, by now should have picked a broader field in which they plan to write their first paper. The seminar would require students to first discuss some key findings of that field and set the stage for discussing their chosen research question and how they plan to execute it.",
Machine Learning in Policy,90904,12," Machine learning, a field derived primarily from computer science and statistics, has matured and gained wide adoption over past decades. Alongside exponential increases in data measurement and availability, the ability to develop appropriate and tailored analyses is in demand. As practitioners in the social sciences consider machine learning methods, however, we are identifying limitations and externalities of the applications of machine learning techniques, such as overconfidence in settings with concept drift, lack of generalizability due to selection bias, and magnification of inequities. Machine Learning and Policy seeks to (1) demonstrate motivations and successes of machine learning, to (2) contrast them with more classical methods, and to (3) investigate the promise and cautions of machine learning for public policy. The course will cover variety of topics, including: Basics of machine learning; probability/Bayes/likelihood/conjugacy, terminology, code/algorithm design, evaluation, mathematical formulations Popular and well-performing methods; random forests/trees/ensembles, neural networks/backpropagation/embeddings/generalized adversarial networks, generalized linear models/shrinkage/convexity/basis functions, support vector machines/kernels/optimization/Lagrangian Leveraging other data sources; natural language processing/topic modeling/relational (non-i.i.d.)/relational (Markov logic networks)/temporal data Additional topics: causality/confounding/propensity scoring/inverse weighting/causal directed acyclic graphs, fairness/ethics, interpretation/explanation/visualization, anomaly detection, semi-supervised and active learning, reinforcement learning For policy students, Machine Learning and Policy will develop your skills in machine learning methods motivated by policy applications. For machine learning students, Machine Learning and Policy will develop your ability to formulate machine learning techniques that inform real-world policy and will demand that the formulations address the applications, consequences and limitations of existing techniques. Students will present mathematical formulations in TeX and markdown and implement algorithms in Python. Machine Learning and Policy will also involve a substantial discussion component.

Statistical Theory for Social and Policy Research,90905,12," Since social and policy analysis is rooted in empirical studies of complex phenomena, researchers make extensive use of statistical tools in designing data capture, obtaining useful information from data, and presenting results convincingly to various audiences. Probability and statistical theory provide the basis for these effective statistical tools. At the doctoral research level, you gain confidence in the application of statistical tools as you better understand probability and statistical theory. Further, probability and statistical theory provides background for more advanced methodology courses such as econometrics, probabilistic operations research, decision analysis and multivariate statistical analysis. Additionally, and importantly at the PhD level, having skills in probability and statistical theory permits the researcher to tailor statistical techniques and probabilistic methods to the problem at hand, rather than forcing the problem into a set of cookbook procedures. Student Audience: Within the Heinz School, 90-905 is appropriate for first-year PhD students plus first and second year Masters students who desire and are prepared for a rigorous theory course in probability and statistics as a base for more advanced research methodology. Outside the Heinz school, 90-905 may be of interest to graduate students in Applied History, Architecture, Engineering and Public Policy, GSIA, Philosophy, Psychology, or Social and Decision Science who need background in probability and statistical theory targeted toward social and policy research. Coverage: This is a fast moving one semester course that focuses on basic concepts of mathematical probability and statistical theory. Topics covered include: joint, marginal, and conditional probability, Bayes rule, probability distributions, principles of statistical inference, sampling distributions, maximum likelihood, non-parametric estimation, Bayesian methods, the bootstrap, and regression.",
PhD Econometrics I,90906,12," Empirical research is most valuable when it uses data to answer specific causal questions, as if in a randomized clinical trial. In the absence of a real experiment, we look for well-controlled comparisons and/or natural quasi-experiments. Some research designs are more convincing than others, but the econometric methods behind them are almost always fairly simple. This course provides an introduction to the most important items in an applied econometrician’s toolkit: (i) analysis of randomized controlled trials; (ii) regression models designed to control for variables that may mask the causal effects of interest; (iii) difference-in-differences-type strategies that use repeated observations to control for unobserved omitted factors; and (iv) instrumental variables and regression discontinuity methods for the analysis of real and natural experiments. In this course, emphasis will be given to conceptual issues and simple statistical techniques that turn up in the applied research we read and do. Many empirical examples will illustrate these ideas and techniques. Prerequisite 90-905: Statistical Theory for Social and Policy Research (or equivalent) The main prerequisite for this course is basic training in probability and statistics. Students should be comfortable with the elementary tools of statistical inference, such as t-statistics and standard errors. Familiarity with fundamental probability concepts such as mathematical expectation in also helpful, but extraordinary mathematical sophistication is not required.","Learning Outcomes: Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to: 1. Understand the key elements of regression analysis. 2. Use the core methods in today’s econometric toolkit in empirical analysis – e.g., linear regression for statistical control, instrumental variable methods for the analysis of real and natural experiments, and difference-and-difference methods that exploit policy changes."
Econometric Theory and Methods,90907,12," This course covers a number of econometric models and techniques that are commonly used in applied microeconomics. The core topics include a general framework for estimators (which includes maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments), discrete outcome models, sample selection (and related limited dependent variable or switching models), duration and count models, time series models, panel data models, variance estimation (including clustering and the bootstrap), and non-parametric techniques. The course is designed for PhD students who have completed 90-907 (PhD Econometrics I) or an equivalent course.","Learning Outcomes: Demonstrate that a broad class of linear and non-linear statistical models fit within the M-estimator framework. Derive consistency and asymptotic normality of M-estimators. Utilize statistical techniques outside of the traditional M-estimator framework such as non-parametric estimation, bootstrap, etc. Understand how to use these methods in cross-sectional versus time-series versus panel data settings. Apply these estimators to data as part of course assignments."
Ph.D. Microeconomics,90908,12," Microeconomics is the study of the ways in which individuals and firms make choices, and how these choices interact. Economics shares with other behavioral sciences the general goal of explaining and predicting human behavior. The distinguishing feature of the economic approach is an emphasis on rational decision-making under conditions of scarcity. Because of the central role of markets, i.e., the price system, in describing the outcomes of individual and firm decision-making, microeconomics is sometimes called price theory. Ph.D. Microeconomics I provides a semester-long introduction to microeconomic theory and its application. The primary objective of the course is to familiarize students with the microeconomic paradigm, and develop an appreciation of the usefulness (and limitations) of microeconomic analysis. A further goal of the course is to develop and exercise students’ ability to use economic analysis in examining applied issues, and, more generally, to help students acquire formal modeling skills—the ability to reduce real-world problems to useful and mathematically tractable representations. This course is designed for the following students: (i) Ph.D. students who want to increase their exposure to microeconomics, but do not expect to use formal microeconomics in their research (i.e., students for whom this course is likely to be their last course in microeconomics); (ii) Ph.D. students who plan to study microeconomics beyond the introductory level of this course, but do not have the background for the Ph.D. economic theory sequence offered at the Tepper School; and (iii) masters level students (or perhaps the occasional undergraduate) with an especially high level of interest and a good background in mathematics. Note that this course is not a close substitute for the first course in the Tepper School microeconomics sequence (Ph.D. Intermediate Microeconomics). Some students may find this course to be a useful supplementary course to Ph.D. Intermediate Microeconomics. Students who have sufficient preparation are encouraged to investigate the Ph.D. Intermediate Microeconomics offered at the Tepper School. There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, students are assumed to have a solid working knowledge of multivariate calculus. You will take a brief math quiz in the first lecture to help you determine whether your math training is sufficient for the course. Prior exposure to microeconomics, in a good undergraduate-level course, is helpful but not required.",

Financial Analysis For Managers,91804,12," Financial Analysis is a course designed to introduce critical reading of financial information (not just formal statements) and deepen an understanding of financial analysis tools and concepts that are not addressed in Accounting courses but are essential to everyday management. The course is broken down into discrete sections to offer the student two functional focuses for success in financial analysis, regardless of its profit motives or stakeholders. • Assessing Financial Health & Planning Financial Performance: financial information identification and analysis, cost behaviors and types, cash flow and working capital analysis, and time value of money. These practices are objective, and considered the “tools of the trade.” These tools are relatively universal and easily modified for applicability to Non-profit and For-profit alike. • Interpretation and recommendation. This is the managerial use of the information provided by the assessments and analyses described above. These practices can be highly objective, intuitive, and heavily reliant upon common-sense and an understanding of accounting.","Learning Outcomes: The student will be introduced to, learn how and when to use, and apply in practice the financial-analytical tools required to make effective business & policy decisions. The course topics present analytical paradigms that can be nurtured, utilized and adapted to deal with all financial entities, both personally."
Organizational Change,91809,6," This course focuses on the key processes of effective organizational change. Our objective is to provide frameworks and tools for successfully introducing and sustaining organizational change; then, to give you opportunities to practice using and customizing them to your particular change situation(s). Topics include diagnosis (assessment of need for change), initiation (start), implementation (carry out), and institutionalization of change (making it optimally effective and enduring). The course is organized around readings, reflections, presentations, discussions, cases, lectures, videos, exercises, and a project.","Learning Outcomes: 1. To understand the challenges and complexities of changes in complex organizations. 2. To acquire and learn to adapt frameworks for diagnosing organizational states, analyzing organizational change strategies, and implementing and institutionalizing change. 3.

To understand change from the perspective of the person(s) initiating change, the person(s) receiving change, and broader stakeholders."
Optimization and Risk Modeling for Managers,91819,6," This course has four objectives besides learning a variety of spreadsheet skills. First, you should learn about a variety of management science techniques, what they are capable of, and what their limitations are so that you can intelligently call upon specialists and consultants when the occasion arises. Second, you should acquire sufficient proficiency with some of the techniques that you can use them as an “end user modeler”. Third, you should learn how to approach, abstract, and analyze problems from a quantitative, analytical perspective. In short, you should be able to use the language of mathematical modeling. In most lectures we will work through a small “case” to help you connect the methods to a problem that is richer than the typical end of chapter problem. Fourth, doing these things will prepare you to manage staff who are doing analytics projects. Walking a mile in their shoes (reflectively), will help you understand what they can and cannot do to create value for your organization. The course moves quickly; be careful not to fall behind. Unless I explicitly say otherwise, always read the assigned readings before the class in which they are discussed; failing to do so is the most common reason for failing the course.",
Strategic Planning,91820,12," This course emphasizes strategic planning processes and focusses on setting strategic objectives and developing strategies for implementing those objectives. The course teaches students the building blocks of strategic planning and introduces students to the contested theories of how to develop and implement plans. The content of the course includes exploring the basic concepts used in strategic planning; distinguishing between operational matters (organisational effectiveness) and strategic matters (leadership); analysing the organisations internal and external environments; and achieving alignment between them. A considerable amount of time is spent on developing skills to frame issues correctly so that strategic plans address the organisation’s true needs.

Power And Influence,91843,6," Power is the ability to get things done. It is fundamental for taking action in organizations and in society. Organizations are political institutions, and effectively mobilizing resources to get things done is essential if a manager is to be effective in their job. In this course we want to understand what power is, how it is acquired and how to use it to accomplish personal and organizational goals. Managers and members of organizations have different interests and resources. They are interdependent. When interdependent organizational actors with different interests need to attain certain goals, this can not be done without working with and through others. Consequently, we need to find ways to influence others to act in ways which they might not choose to do otherwise. This creates political pressures and processes requiring political action, creating power dynamics in organizations. In this course, we want to explore organizational power and politics to help you to learn to more effectively manage in an organization. We will examine several issues including: What is power? Who gets power and how do they hold on to it? How do you feel about power? What is the role of personality? What factors determine how power is distributed in an organization? Diagnosing political processes in an organization Developing influence in organizations The impact on us of power and powerlessness",

Museum Operations,93807,6," Museums share a responsibility for presenting, preserving, and interpreting arts, culture, history, and heritage for the benefit of the public and society. Yet, each museum has its own unique set of challenges and complexities, managed by a team of staff and board members who all share in the delivery of a museum’s mission, vision, and values. In this course, students will gain an understanding of what a museum is and how it is governed, explore the various operational processes required to run a museum, learn how museums care for and present their collections, and identify the role museums play in serving the needs of visitors and communities. Students will develop an appreciation for program planning and the decision-making processes needed for the allocation of resources. Museum roles and responsibilities, current trends, external relations and engagement functions will also be explored. A range of museum types will be highlighted including art museums, natural history museums, children’s museums, science centers, craft centers, and others. Course work will require students to make connections between theory, practice, and implementation, ultimately providing insight into the many factors inherent in running a museum in the 21st century.","Learning Outcomes: Skills and knowledge gained through this class will be assessed through analysis and discussion of readings, class participation, and assignments.

Producing A Performing Arts Season,93811,6," The performing arts industry has had a varied and lively history in the United States for the last 175 years (essentially once train travel allowed for broad distribution of artists across the nation). In the beginning the arts were for entertainment and profit. Today, the need to entertain and pay the bills persists, yet it is set within a (mostly) nonprofit landscape in which performing arts organizations produce works to transform audiences via one or several intersecting art forms. Producing a successful season entails selection (planning) and implementation (managing) of programs, something that is neither easy nor consistent. Driving and complicating the situation is the usual bifurcated management structure. Managers must find a way to implement the vision an Artistic Director – an individual with an aesthetic framework. Arts managers enable his or her artistic vision within the context of the physical, geographical and financial situation of a company. Combining and mixing these forces is frequently messy and always an adventure. Organizational history provides some structures to the process, but each season brings new artistic and managerial challenges against a backdrop of a rapidly changing society. If a career of ‘doing the same thing’ is the goal then a different field might be recommended. This course will examine approaches to producing a performing arts season of programming with an emphasis on the nonprofit season structure. Over 7 short weeks we will attempt to answer the following question: How do managers move an organization mission through an artistic vision set across a selection of programs and create a system to manage the process and evaluate both artistic success but community impact and mission-centric strategic goals? How can arts leaders commission new works in an environment that provides greater earned income for doing things people already know?","Learning Outcomes: • Mission, strategy and planning as it influences and drives programming across an institution • Management Systems and Models o Logic Model applications in the creative enterprises o Fundamental management techniques o Emerging models from entrepreneurial management in a social world • Artistic, institutional and budgetary frameworks driving organization program decisionmaking • The complex path from season conception to implementation and evaluation • The process of negotiating and contracting an individual program’s intersecting parts. • The unique forces professional union contracts impart on the structure of a season. • Opportunities for extended life (and income) to an organization’s intellectual property. • The role of arts education and community engagement in an organization’s programming agenda."

Audience Engagement and Participation,93815,6," This course embraces the fact that the relationship between arts organizations and their audiences is changing. The arts organization developed during or prior to the 20th century must meet the expectations of a 21st century patron. To do so, the industrial age models of artistic delivery are adapting to a technology-infused, social landscape. The relationship is no longer paternal. Increasingly arts organizations are serving “prosumers” in a climate where patrons come to arts events armed with (or at least an ability the ability to bring) an expertise to the experience previously unattainable without degrees in the field. In addition, studies have demonstrated that the process of attending an artistic event begins much earlier and extends much later than the actual event itself – a process ignored by most arts organizations. Finally, arts organizations are increasingly recognizing their role in their community has shifted from that of a delivery vehicle of material from a position of expert to that of a community member and co-creator of the current and future artistic enterprise in their patrons’ cultural landscape. Organized in a self-curated, seminar format, the course provides the student with an immersion into history, frameworks, theories and practices of creating audience engagement and / or active participation programs. Discussion will also address the need in the 21st century for cultivating a shift in an organization culture to fully embrace this change in audience relationships. As the field is adapting quickly to new audience demands, the course will focus on current leaders in the engagement field as they develop and analyze the various forces that created each unique program.","Learning Outcomes: • Understand the shifting relationship between arts organizations and audiences including the social, technologic, economic, and cultural practices that frame the current changes. • Account the trends in the US in both consumption and participation in the arts • Be able to compare and contrast theories of both online and live forms of audience engagement and participation • Understand how organization systems and structures can either support or diminish long term engagement success • Create a rudimentary audience engagement program for an organization • Evaluate the path from institution through artistic creation to distribution into audience engagement, attendance and participation • Understand the evaluation frameworks for successful engagement and their relationship to overall organization success."

Graded assignments will center on individual and group research and the construction of planning guides and tool mastery.",
Experience Design for Cultural Institutions,93817,3," This course examines how cultural institutions can apply human-centered design processes to build innovative experiences that respond to audience needs. Each session will take place at a different arts organization in Pittsburgh, focusing on how arts managers incorporate iterative design processes, user research and evaluation, and prototyping in their work. By delving into three case studies, students will examine how cultural institutions and performing arts venues can use technology and design to connect to new and traditionally underserved audiences, explore ways in which organizations invite their audiences to co-create through high and low tech, and learn how to design cultural experiences that are participatory in nature. For the final project, students will work in teams to define a design challenge, gather information through user research, brainstorm and synthesize ideas, and propose a solution or prototype. PLEASE NOTE: This course meets on October 27 10am-1pm, October 28 10am-1pm, November 2 2pm-5pm, and November 3 10am-1pm.

External Relations: Arts Marketing and PR,93821,6," The success of arts and cultural institutions in the 21st century and beyond will depend upon creative, unconventional and coordinated long-­-range approaches to marketing. Marketing is a core activity of any arts enterprise. Today’s marketing professionals are crucial to their arts organizations; they maintain existing audiences, secure new audiences, create future donors, and create the brand for the institution. They interact with all aspects of the organization, from personnel to fundraising. This course provides readings and professional presentations to guide the understanding of successful marketing, while following a project-­-based method to allow students to investigate hands-­-on the opportunities available to the strategic arts marketer, the changing with the arts audience, and the shifting digital landscape for marketing the arts in the United States. The focus of the course is marketing within a nonprofit arts organization, while recognizing that the audience doesn’t typically distinguish the difference; yet, due to budget and purpose, marketing not-­-for-­-profit arts organizations is significantly different as compared to a for-­-profit entertainment venture.

External Relations: Fundraising & Philanthropy,93826,6," This course introduces the distinctive qualities of American philanthropy, and explores the roles and responsibilities you will have as a professional fundraiser or as a staff member in a non-profit arts organization. In this fundamentals course the focus is on individual donors - their motivations, sources of contributed funds, and new and emerging fundraising techniques, although we will also explore the broad philanthropic landscape as a whole. Additional topics include legal requirements and ethical considerations that are important to fundraising, effective data management and its effects on the success of your fundraising efforts, solicitation strategies and effective communication with donors, and the principles of donor centered fundraising. We will explore the idea of a non-profit environment in transition, an environment where the fields of arts and culture compete with social services, education, and global philanthropic needs for a limited pool of dollars; where we are under increasing pressure to make the case for relevance and civic stature; where our funders - whether individual philanthropists, foundations, corporations, or government - have changing and higher expectations around both involvement and accountability.","Learning Outcomes: Whether you are a development professional or in an artistic or other management role, you will need to understand the key concepts of fundraising in a nonprofit arts organization.

External Relations: Sponsorships and Grants,93827,6," Building on the fundamentals introduced in External Relations: Fundraising and Philanthropy (93-826) this course examines how fundraising theory works practically to support sponsorship programs and grant activities in nonprofit arts organizations of various sizes. The course will begin with a discussion of the funding landscape, as defined by public agencies, private foundations, and corporations.

Finally, we will research funding opportunities, write our own proposals, and conduct a peer review process in order to evaluate grant proposals.",
Advanced Topics in Fundraising,93828,6," This course will go beyond the basics introduced in Fundraising Fundamentals and cover a number of special topics including fundraising campaigns, planned giving, special events, individual major gifts, the use of fundraising consultants, and the creation of a development plan. In smaller organizations, every member of the development office likely needs to have at least a passing familiarity with these topics. In a larger organization, you might be in a position focused on only one area. In either case, having an understanding of these topics and the strategies that inform their use will be a valuable tool. In each section, we may hear from experts in that particular discipline to provide context based on their own experiences.","Learning Outcomes: By the end of this course you will understand the basic principles of a number of specific topics in fundraising.

Law And The Arts,93831,12," LAW AND THE ARTS is an investigation of specific legal rights and responsibilities (contractual and otherwise) in the arts and entertainment industries, including visual and performing arts and emerging areas such as multimedia art. The foundation for all activities in the arts is the contract. Accordingly, you will study contract law that will provide a clearer understanding of the requirements that must be met before a valid contract comes into existence. Contract interpretation and enforcement will also be addressed. In addition to contract law, we will also discuss tort law, agency law, corporate, partnership and limited liability company law, personal and real property law, labor and employment law, intellectual property law (copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, rights of publicity, moral rights) and other laws specifically affecting the entertainment industries. Finally, typical performing arts contracts and contractual provisions will be reviewed and the concepts discussed in other parts of the class, as applied to those contracts, will be analyzed.","Learning Outcomes: The overall objective of the course is not to turn the students into lawyers; rather, the goal is to develop an overall framework for legal analysis to enable the student to recognize legal issues when they are presented in order to enable the student to react to and manage legal situations which are commonly encountered in arts organizations.

Arts & Community Development,93832,6," Students in Arts and Community Development (93832) will learn the basics of community development and the role arts and culture can play in creating vibrant and engaged communities in which to live, work, and play. They will become familiar with the work of local municipalities, tourism bureaus, private businesses, and individual stakeholders and understand how the arts can partner with these and other entities to promote economic development, cultural tourism, and placemaking. They will also learn how collective efforts can position the arts as a key partner in solving civic and social concerns. Tools, resources, and case studies will be explored as students discuss the economic and social impact of the arts on communities and design solutions to solve community development matters. This course introduces students to fundamental creative community development practices and equips students with heightened creative leadership skills that can be used toward advanced work in this subject area. Arts and community development is a large and growing field involving a wide range of stakeholders and cross-collaborative partners. Many topics and angles could be covered.

International Perspectives on Managing Arts and Heritage,93836,6," Arts management faces enormous differences in contexts across the world. While systematically detailing these differences would require a whole program on its own, this course will provide a basic understanding of the variety of contexts within an international comparative view, providing some basic analytical tools and developing skills to deal with these aspects. The focus will be on countries other than the US (assuming that CMU students already get a deep knowledge of the domestic reality): based on extensive field research in the last two decades, case studies provided are outside the realm of influence of the common law and commonwealth tradition. A first set of differences refers to ways in which management itself is conceptualized and taught, with a different emphasis given to some basic notions (e.g. the notion of leadership as opposed to a view of management as social practices; the role of goals versus processes). Moreover, serious variations in managing are related to the different role played by philanthropy, the market or the state: elements of public administration are needed to interact with these different contexts; different meanings assumed by cultural polices also need to be understood. Finally, cultural heritage in particular represents an important chapter in arts management in countries that place a greater emphasis on history and cultural traditions. Dealing with heritage requires additional knowledge and skills (e.g. interacting with archaeologists, historians, museologists) and attention to delicate issues of balance between preservation and uses, fragile issues of long term sustainability, and soft implications in terms of identity building. These aspects are challenging, but also represent huge opportunities. A relevant portion of the labor market in countries where cultural heritage plays a crucial role (Europe, China and Asia, but also Latin America and possibly Africa) is calling for the contribution of arts managers. This also represents a challenge and potential opportunity for US students, to be part of a process of awareness building of heritage even in the US; and in any case, to be ready to interact with international cooperation wherein heritage is part of arts management.",
Special Topics: Managing Activist Art,93840,6," The course will examine two areas of artistic endeavor: 1. The world of activist and dissident artists and how governments and institutions react and respond to their work 2. Managing the artists and organizations who use their work to effect social change Artistic expression has been used throughout history to provoke, explain, refute and support policies both social and governmental. Authorities have responded to artists in a variety of ways, from developing policies to stifle artistic expression, to adopting new rules or laws to address issues in a positive way, to incarceration of artists and worse. At the same time, there are numerous examples of how individual and collective actions of artists have encouraged (forced?) those in power to address issues and adopt specific cultural policies to embrace social change. Areas of inquiry: • Differences between activist, dissident and anarchist artist • Subject areas that are likely to be of concern to artists • The relationship of creative need relative to the artist’s priorities • How governments and institutions respond to activist art • Examples of provocative art leading to policy development • The place of Nationalism in art and where we stand today • Relationship between law and activist artist",
Live Music: Touring and Revenue Streams,93844,6," Many music industry executives assert that while the top 5% of music artists can still make money selling records, the other 95% go on tour.

Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship,93853,9," This is not a technical or creative course. We won’t learn to write code, nor will we produce any creative work. Instead, we’ll examine business models, distribution philosophies and the physics of media as they apply to for-profit companies in TV, Film and Music. We’ll start with an overview of Internet history and vocabulary, designed to make students fluent in the business language of the Web and mobile.

Film Acquisition,93854,3," Independent film is a term loosely used to mean many things. While the term is often times used to label a genre, it is also a financing method. An independent film can cost $300 and be constructed on a home computer or it could cost $200 million with a studio paying a surplus on top of the budget to distribute it. The class will dive into both the genre and financing method and how this part of the business is one of the most important sectors that affects almost every piece of acting and filmmaking talent. The glamorous and not so glamorous world of film festivals are where studios scour for up-and-coming talent, where actors go to gain credibility and where has-beens turn to resurrect careers.

Unstructured Data Analytics for Policy,94775,6," Many organizations need to analyze large amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video to discover useful information. For example, a company may want to monitor how the public discusses its products in social media, or a forensics team may need to discover the contents of disk drives seized by law enforcement. A recurring issue is that we often do not know what structure is present in the data initially. This course provides students with an understanding of common and emerging methods of organizing, summarizing, and analyzing large collections of this unstructured data (“unstructured data analytics”). There is some programming although the emphasis of the course will be more on concepts. For students interested in more hands-on experience with the coding aspects, consider taking 95-865 instead. Prerequisites: None","Learning Outcomes: By the end of the course, students are expected to have developed the following skills. Skills are assessed by the homework assignments and the final exam. * Recall and discuss common methods of conducting exploratory and predictive analysis of unstructured data; * Write Python code for exploratory and predictive data analysis; and * Apply unstructured data analysis techniques discussed in class to solve problems faced by governments and companies."
Negotiation,94800,6," Negotiation is the process by which two or more parties with interdependent interests secure agreements. This course is designed to cover the range of negotiation situations and issues faced by managers and decision makers. This course explores negotiations in many contexts: simple personal transactions, public and private sector collective bargaining, resolving disputes out of court, resolving conflicting interests within an organization, and resolving conflicting interests across organizations. This course will also explore ethical issues in negotiation and cognitive biases of negotiators. The objectives of this course are the following: - Introduce students to the analytical framework and concepts necessary to understand the complexity and dynamics of negotiation - Improve ability to analyze negotiations in a variety of contexts - Learn to balance the implicit tradeoffs of competition and cooperation inherent in most negotiations - Introduce students to a variety of tactics and strategies employed in negotiations - Improve ability to conduct successful negotiations - Learn to recognize more opportunities to negotiate",
Acting for Management,94801,6," Actors use ""tools"" (their voice, body, focus) to convey emotion and tell stories to audiences. Acting for Management will help you utilize the actor's tools to become a more powerful and persuasive presenter, to feel more confident when communicating with others, to understand your audience and to show the world the best and most authentic version of you. Through in-class exercises, prepared acting scenes and discussion, we will explore the use of physical tools (voice and body) as well as non-physical tools (self-awareness, imagination, emotion, focus, intention). Exercises and scenes will include situations you will encounter in professional organizations such as teamwork, conflict and power, among others. Because success in professional settings depends on your ability to clearly and dynamically communicate your ideas and skillfully navigate the ""politics"" of the organization, our focus for the class will be how to transfer the actor's tools to real-world situations. Acting for Management is about you and your individual growth. To make the most of it, you will need to attend all classes and participate fully in activities.","Learning Outcomes: At the conclusion of this class, you should: -Be able to define your strengths as a presenter and areas for continued work -Use the actor's tools to shape your performances and presentations -Exhibit increased confidence in performing and presenting -See an increase in your willingness to be spontaneous and take risks"
Geographic Information Systems,94802,12," A geographic information system (GIS) provides storage, retrieval, and visualization of geographically referenced data as well as design and analysis of geospatial information. GIS provides unique analytical tools to investigate spatial relationships, patterns, and processes of cultural, biological, demographic, economic, social, environmental, health, criminal, and other phenomena. This course uses a unique approach for teaching GIS. It imbeds learning how to use GIS software in the context of carrying out projects for visualizing and analyzing spatial data. Each week includes online lectures, readings, and other materials to learn concepts associated with each topic. Weekly tutorials use Esri's ArcGIS Pro and Platform technologies to analyze data or solve a problem. Students learn to create online Story Maps to convey their maps and associated information to the public and decision makers. By the end of the course, students will identify the relevant spatial characteristics of diverse application areas enabling professionals to integrate spatial thinking and GIS analysis into their careers and will gain a significant advantage in the information technology field.",Learning Outcomes: 1.

Consulting Lab,94803,6," ConsultingLab is an interdisciplinary class and research project open to students from across the University. Unlike traditional case-based management consulting classes ConsultingLab does real projects for real clients, and delivers real outcomes that have included a range of work products, from presentations of findings to recommendations to management to application development and installation. A few of our many past projects: · Using census and county-level data to design and produce a web-based application that aligned optimal food distribution sites with the greatest concentration of the at-risk school-age population. This resulted in 16% more kids eating healthy lunches over their summer school break. ConsultingLab teams will soon begin on Phase 2 of this project. · Helping a museum store better understand its customers' purchase patterns to optimize its offerings and increase profit while maintaining alignment with the museum's mission. · A three-year network analysis of an online twitter chat community to maximize the social networks of participants and followers and produce a model to better analyze the relationship between topic, participation, impact and action. · Developing a task tracking system for an overwhelmed NGO to aid in monitoring specific assignments from start to finish, sharable internally and externally. · Determining the barriers to engagement, and their mitigation, to a science museum's STEM outreach to underrepresented students and families. In addition to the projects, research is gathered on what makes for the most -- and least -- successful consulting engagements. This has resulted in a unique knowledgebase of best (and worst) practices, and a unique consulting methodology called The ConsultingLab Way that uses elements of Design Thinking, Agile methodologies, various research methodologies, principles of organizational development, and traditional analytics to design solutions to a wide range of systems-oriented problems.","Learning Outcomes: • Get you comfortable with communicating yourself and your ideas to small & large groups; • Give you immediately-applicable skills to apply; • Expose you to a variety of “consulting situations”, including replying to RFPs, writing good emails, team participation and leadership, presentation skills, “reading” clients, and developing relationships; • Have you come out a more prepared, confident, and comfortable professional, able to present yourself and your ideas more clearly, powerfully, and effectively, and add value to the consultant-client relationship at every stage."
Transformational Leadership,94804,6," The game is changing on the world stage.This requires a new type of leadership and new types of strategies. We will look at the role of the leader in the emerging global and digital world. The context of global leadership has significantly changed in the past 5 years. Technology and social media have been game changers and a number of leaders still do not use them effectively. Regardless of your title, or the job you have you will have to display leadership qualities if you want to get ahead, get noticed and close the gap between your aspirations and your reality. Evidence based transformational leadership is driven from inner values and convictions. It is important to understand what research has shown us that constitutes effective leadership and the difference between transactional and transformational leadership. It is also important to identify how to adapt your leadership style to a situation, person or organisation’s culture. A number of people espouse principles of good leadership but are very poor at practicing them. Whether you are leading in a global enterprise or a local organization, good leadership principles are the same. Regardless of your context, you will have to learn how to lead and communicate across social media platforms, respectfully and effectively lead in a culturally diverse environment and be rapidly adaptable to change. This course will discuss the evidence base for transformational leadership, a variety of models of transformational leadership, what that means for you and how to match the right leadership model to your personality, style and work context.",Learning Outcomes: At the conclusion of this course students will be able to: • Discern between transformational and transactional leadership; • Develop leadership paradigms to match our emerging global and digital society; • Discuss and debate good practice leading in a culturally diverse environment; • Identify the organizational barriers-and solutions- to transformational leadership; • Strengthen their emotional intelligence to become a more effective leader.
Privacy in the Digital Age,94806,6," Privacy is a complex and multi-faceted concept. This course combines technical, economic, legal,and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age. The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive. Is there a “sweet” spot that satisfies the interests of all parties? Is there a combination of technological solutions, economic incentives, and legal safeguards that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society? This course tries to address the above questions. In particular, the course begins by comparing early definitions of privacy to the current information-focused debate. It then focuses on: - technological aspects of privacy (privacy concerns raised by new IT such as the Internet, wireless communications, and computer matching; tracking techniques and data mining; privacy enhancing technologies and anonymous protocols, …), - economic aspects (economic models of the market for privacy, financial risks caused by privacy violations, the value of customer information, …), - legal aspects (laissez-faire versus regulated approaches, US versus EU legal safeguards, …) - managerial implications (the emerging role of Chief Privacy Officers, compulsory directives and self-regulative efforts, …), and - policy aspects (trade-offs between individual privacy rights and societal needs, …) Let me repeat a key word from the above description: “holistic.” This term refers to the fact that we will try to cover different angles of the privacy debate, and we will try to connect and contrast each angle to the others. The approach of this class therefore somewhat privileges breadth over depth (while offering tools and directions for more focused analysis), in order to give you a broad and varied understanding of privacy problems in a networked digital society. (For this reason, this class also provides some preparation and introduction for/to other courses you may take at the Heinz College.) Finally, the intention of the class is not to scare you into believing that every instance of information disclosure is a privacy invasion. Instead, the goal is to educate you about the kinds of information that may be gathered about individuals, and to help you determine the individual and societal trade-offs associated with accepting or avoiding its collection and/or use. Since privacy is a very subjective and contextual feeling, what may be a privacy invasion for you in one setting may not be in another. The challenge we present to you in this course is to understand the difference.","Learning Outcomes: The main objective of this course is to provide an informed and critical view of the role and value of privacy in the digital age. Because privacy is a complex and multi-faceted concept, the course aims to present and combine technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives."

Evidence-Based Management,94814,6," Contemporary managers are heavily swayed in their thinking and decisions by habit, fads, convention and unrealistic levels of confidence (March, 2010; Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006). Managers practicing EBMgt learn how to rethink their approaches to data and knowledge in order to make more effective decisions. EBMgt means making decisions based on best obtainable evidence, that is, scientific findings and unbiased organizational facts. These decisions rely on decision processes that reduce bias and judgment errors and give due consideration to ethical concerns. This mini course promotes your understanding and use of EBMgt principles. It also guides you in developing the skills and knowledge needed to identify, access, and use quality evidence from science and practice in making better decisions. The instructor is committed to pursuing an evidence-based approach to the course itself.

Survey Design,94828,6," This course is designed to provide students with a solid practical foundation in survey research methodology. We will begin by discussing how to formulate good research questions and the types of research questions that can be investigated through survey research. (Although we will briefly discuss the various survey formats, this course will focus on designing self-administered questionnaires.) Because the success or failure of a survey project rests on the individual survey items, we will spend the majority of our time learning how to develop, test, and revise survey items. In doing so, we will also consider the cognitive processes that affect how people respond to survey items, in order to ensure we are creating items that are both understandable and answerable. We will also briefly discuss survey instrument organization and design, survey administration techniques, and ethical issues in survey methodology.","Learning Outcomes: At the end of this course, you should be able to: - Develop a set of research questions to guide the survey design and analysis process - Describe each of the steps in designing a survey instrument and analyzing survey data - Articulate a researcher’s ethical responsibilities, particularly regarding respondent protection - Identify improperly formatted survey items within existing survey instruments and suggest revisions to improve understandability and answerability - Recognize and keep in mind that cognitive process exist which can affect how respondents answer survey items - Conduct the iterative process of developing, testing, and revising to create survey items that are understandable and answerable by respondents - Design a well-organized, effectively ordered, and visually appealing survey instrument"
Analysis of Survey Data,94830,6," This course is designed to teach students appropriate analytic methods for answering research questions using existing survey datasets. We will begin by discussing the creation of analysis plans, which will include basic descriptive and inferential analytic methods along with more advanced regression methods. Students will learn how to apply regression methods to survey data, so must have a solid foundation in linear regression and a basic understanding of logistic regression. We will focus on learning the types of data that can be used with particular analytic methods, as well as on learning which types of analytic methods are appropriate for which types of research questions. As such, we will learn when and how to manipulate existing data through the creation of dummy variables or composite variables, through data transformations, and through coding procedures for changing text into analyzable numeric data. We will also learn how to assess the degree of missing data and how to handle problematic levels of missing data, how to interpret statistical results, and how to present findings in text and in graphic format. This course does not include data mining techniques, as we will focus on research question-driven analysis. We will use SAS 9.2 to conduct our analyses, and students will learn SAS procedures appropriate to those analyses. Students who have limited experience with SAS should attend optional Friday SAS workshops, in which they will receive basic instruction on navigating the SAS environment, importing datasets, and writing SAS code.","Learning Outcomes: At the end of this course you should be able to: - Assess the degree of missing data and determine whether missing data are associated with a particular set of respondents - Use appropriate coding techniques to transform text responses into analyzable numeric data - Manipulate data by creating dummy and composite variables - Create an analysis plan for answering the guiding research questions - Perform basic descriptive and relational analyses on collected data - Determine effects of explanatory variables on outcomes of interest using linear and logistic regression - Report survey findings in a clear, understandable manner that focuses on overall meaning rather than individual results"
Design & Policy for Humanitarian Impact,94831,12," In this combined lecture and lab course, students will gain a sense of the history, current state, and future of social innovation with an emphasis on design-centric methods, and the current role public policy, new economies, and design have in shaping and defining conditions for change. This systems thinking approach, when applied to challenges at a societal scale, recognizes the relationship between local, regional national, and international concerns. And, the need to inform through verifiable research and evidence the role that crafters of public policy and design can have in promoting social change.","Learning Outcomes: During the course students will (1) look at the role of design and proven practices, frameworks, and methodologies that identify ""root cause"" humanitarian problems; (2) understand the roles, skills, techniques, and evaluation methods that serve crafters of public policy, and; (3) experiment with the ways that designers and policy makers in a variety of contexts can advance social innovation. In the second half of the course, students will build on earlier work and intensify their use of design frameworks and proven methodologies to conceptualize a solution to a specific social problem with implications on policy creation and/or change, through completion of a project. While some participants may aspire to directly implement practical solutions to social problems in the ""real world"", the course content is applicable to a wide variety of contexts in the public, private, and social sectors."

Decision Analysis and Multi-Criteria Decision Making,94833,6," This course complements and extends both 95-760 Decision Making under Uncertainty and the two mini sequence in Management Science (90-722 & 90-760). Management Science I: Optimization) by addressing three additional topics in managerial decision making: - MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making) - Decision Analysis - Decision processes MCDM is a collection of methods for trading-off different alternatives’ performance on multiple conflicting objectives; methods discussed include weighted sum scoring models, swing weights, TOPSIS, DEA, AHP, and rank-based methods. Decision Analysis is the prescriptive model for rationally maximizing subjective expected utility in the face of uncertainty; it is particularly powerful for dealing with sequential decisions, quantifying the value of information, assessing and incorporating subjective probabilities, and doing Bayesian updates of probabilities as new information becomes available. Decision process considerations go beyond the paradigm of a single well-defined decision maker and mathematical method. Potential topics we could cover include industrial analytics, auctions, composite indicators (“US News & World Report” style ratings), balanced scorecards, “dashboards” of key performance indicators, group processes, and matching a decision method to the circumstances at hand. This course will normally be taken after either 95-760 Decision Making Under Uncertainty or the Management Science sequence (90-722 & 90-760), but the only formal prerequisite is fluency with algebra & Excel and knowledge of probability theory and distributions at a level obtained from having taken, or concurrently taking, one of Heinz’ empirical methods courses. However, the course is pitched at a second-year level; first-year students who are comfortable with quantitative methods are welcome, but first-year students without a quantitative bent are encouraged to wait until their second-year.","Learning Outcomes: The first two topics are skills-oriented. The objective is to empower students to apply the methods in professional practice. Students should leave the class able to apply the methods to routine problems, and with a foundation for further self-study when the decision’s stakes warrant use of more advanced variations of these methods. The last component is more conceptual, providing brief exposure to issues one confronts when bridging between textbook methods and real world implementation. The twin learning goals are knowledge about the issues and ideas and developing critical thinking skills concerning the “meta decision” of when to employ which decision method, and the criteria relevant to making those judgments."

Muslims in a Global Context: Muslim Migrations: Pre-Modern Era,94872,3," WEEKEND COURSE DATES: NOVEMBER 3-5, 2017; COURSE LOCATION: UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH ""To intend a journey,"" is the translation of the Arabic word hajj; it describes both the actual trip through space undertaken by millions of pilgrims, and each one's personal, emotional reasons for migrating. Muslim Migrations: Pre-Modern Era is one of a two-part series exploring the various contexts in which Muslim individuals and populations have migrated since the first migration from Mecca to Medina to the millions of Muslims on the move in the 21st Century. Whether journeying for the sake of learning, resources, or trade; or as the result of war, enslavement, or forced migration, Muslims migrating have had a profound impact around the globe. This multidisciplinary course will explore the social, economic, environmental, and political dimensions of Muslims on the move. In this first 3.0 unit course, we will look at the pre-modern era from the 7th century to the mid 1800's, considering for example the impact of the hajj as the nucleus of thought, the expulsion of Muslims from Medieval Spain, and the forced migration of African Muslims during the trans-Atlantic slave trade to the Americas. The second part in the series will consider various migration trajectories in their colonial and post-colonial contexts, examining in particular the impact of WWI and WWII, histories of de-colonization, the Cold War contexts, and more recent wars, such as the US invasion in Iraq. http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/global/mini-course/pre-modern",
Design Thinking for Complex Systems,94874,6," In the current century, as the distinctions between nature, culture, and the artificial become increasingly blurry, we can no longer talk about interventions within social or economic domains without thinking through them in shape and form of complex socio-technical systems, models of aspects of the world that can guide intentional change. Thinking of designed technologies in relation to different models and ways of seeing and thinking about the word we live in is crucial for practitioners involved in any kind of change through technological interventions, whether at the level of technology production, or deployment, or policy. This mini course introduces students to designerly approaches using systems theory. It aims to sensitize them to a range of different ways to frame and think about systems and expose them to a range of specific systems thinking techniques and terminologies for analyzing complex natural, socio-cultural and technological phenomena and making evaluable changes to those phenomena.

Managing Change in a Disruptive World,94879,6," The world is changing rapidly creating opportunities and new challenges in not only businesses but also for public policy and governance. Disruptive and Transformational technologies add to this mix of complexity and scale of change. This not only requires understanding of the new technologies but appropriately shaping the implementation strategy to leverage the opportunities and contain the challenges. Managing change is a critical skill to sustainably implement the transition lack of it is a sure recipe for failure. To succeed one needs to recognize the challenges arising out of resistance to change. The course will prepare students by exposing them to the principles of change management - from recognizing the need for change to preparing and executing a change management strategy particularly in the context of public policy. To achieve this, a mixture of theory/case studies in private sector / public sector and Government will build the skills to be an effective change agent in the changing world. Course Description What? What is change management? We all have learnt about Newton’s first law in physics also known as law of inertia – good news is that we know it applies to physical bodies when force is applied to it and we know what to do about it. Bad news is that it applies to organizations and individuals also and most of us don’t know what to do about it. We all resist change. Why? Why should we worry about it? John Kotter – the change management guru estimated in 1995 that only 30% programs succeeded – in 2008 Mc Kinsey estimated pretty much the same – 70% projects failure could be attributed to resistance to change and management behaviors that do not support change. As change becomes more rapid and complex with disruptive technological change, it is even more imperative to be cognizant and competent in recognizing and mitigating the change management challenges, lest best designed projects fail. A good technical design of the project is necessary but not sufficient for project success - the latter requires change management to be integral to the design. Thus, managing change is a critical skill – lack of it is a sure recipe for failure. The challenges arising out of managing change are even more larger and relevant for public policy and governance as the canvas of action, actors in play, scale of change and outcomes are gargantuan compared to private sector. How? A good public policy design must incorporate the best principles of change management especially in the wake of new technologies. To succeed one needs to recognize the challenges arising out of “resistance to change” in public sector where incentives are even more diffused. The course will prepare students by exposing them to the principles of change management - from recognizing the need for change to preparing and executing a change management strategy particularly in the context of public policy. If you want to be an effective leader, you better be a competent change agent too. The students will learn from a mix of theory, case studies from public/private sector (some of which may be presented by the students) and external speakers (depending on availability).","Learning Outcomes: At the end of the course, the students should be able to: • Understand the challenges arising out a change • Appreciate the centrality of a change management to success of a public policy/project • Identify risks to the success from resistance to change at individual, collective and organizational levels • Be able to design a change management plan to mitigate these risks to the policy thereby improving the chances of success. Potential Assessments The assessments / assignments may include mixture of analysis of case studies / presentations in groups, individual written assignment on a change managed successfully (for example in your own life), preparing/presenting a change management plan for a change management problem and/or a final exam. The aim of assessments would be to incentivize and internalize learning."

"A/B Testing, Design and Analysis",95819,6," This course looks at how to use A/B testing to measure causal effects in online platforms in the era of big data analytics. We aim at answering questions such as how does the demand for a product change when the price does or the ratings do? How can we anticipate how sales and profits change if the firm changes its business strategy? Facebook, Google, Amazon and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms. This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild and in network settings. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and can be applied in settings other than online platforms such as energy, transportation and education. The examples in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at the Heinz College on the media industry. Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts behind A/B tests and what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas and intuition behind these concepts. In the second half of each lecture we go over specific examples -- we study the associated datasets and the code used to analyze them properly. Student evaluation is based on five weekly homeworks and a brief term project to be developed in teams.

Product Management in Information Technology,95821,6," This introductory course (6 Units) is designed for MISM and MSIT students who are interested in exploring the roles and responsibilities of product management. Product managers provide a critical leadership role and have the responsibility of making the product or service successful through planning, development and marketing activities. They must manage the product in a complex, fluid environment affected by many influences such as customer needs, competitive offerings and threats, strategic planning and development cycles, budgetary constraints, product costs, and “make vs. buy” decisions – to name just a few. While these roles and responsibilities appear critical (as well as interesting) to the success of a product or service, product management is not always part of an organization, at least at first. Companies typically implement the product management function when a lack of coordination, communication and planning cause ineffective product developments, missed schedules, lost revenues, and disgruntled sales and development personnel (much less, dissatisfied customers!). Engineers and technical support personnel who show some level of interest or knowledge about the customer, competition, and/or business are “promoted” to product manager roles, often with little or no product management training or understanding. Note that these situations apply not only to products offered to “external” customers, but also to products and services offered by IT to “internal” customers (i.e. co-workers). Read any IT-oriented business journal these days, and one will quickly understand the need for IT to be relevant to the business. This can be difficult for IT personnel who do not fully appreciate their “customers” needs, much less competition. As such, this course discusses the need for product management roles and responsibilities for both external and internal products. Product management jobs are ideally suited for those who want a leadership role that combines one’s business interests with one’s technical knowledge and skills. This course assumes the students have plenty of other courses and experiences related to technical skills and knowledge; so, this course focuses on the business and managerial considerations, methods and tools of the product management function.","Learning Outcomes: 1. Define product management 2. Summarize the needs and requirements of product management; 3. Describe the “4 pillars” of product management’s roles and responsibilities across the product lifecycle, along with base responsibilities, regardless of lifecycle phase; 4.

Machine Learning for Problem Solving,95828,12," Machine Learning (ML) is centered around automated methods that improve their own performance through learning patterns in data, and then using the uncovered patterns to predict the future and make decisions. ML is heavily used in a wide variety of domains such as business, finance, healthcare, security, etc. for problems including display advertising, fraud detection, disease diagnosis and treatment, face/speech recognition, automated navigation, to name a few. “If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.” — Albert Einstein “A problem well put is half solved.” — John Dewey The main premise of the course is to equip students with the intuitive understanding of machine learning concepts grounded in real-world applications. The course is designed to deliver the practical knowledge and experience necessary for recognizing and formulating machine learning problems in the wild, as well as of applying machine learning techniques effectively in practice. The emphasis will be on learning and practicing the machine learning process, involving the cycle of feature design, modeling, and evaluation. “All models are wrong, but some models are useful.” — George Box As there exists “no free lunch”, we will cover a wide range of different models and learning algorithms, which can be applied to a variety of problems and have varying speed-accuracy-interpretability tradeoffs. In particular, the topics include supervised learning: linear models, decision trees, ensemble methods, kernel methods, nonparametric learning, and unsupervised learning: density estimation, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. The class will include biweekly homework each containing a mini-project (i.e., a problem solving assignment that involves programming) in addition to other conceptual and technical questions, a midterm, a final exam, and a case study at the end of the course. The case study gives students a chance to dig into a substantial problem using a large dataset and apply machine learning concepts they have learned throughout the course.

Applied Analytics: the Machine Learning Pipeline,95845,12," Machine learning is a highly valued set of analytics techniques, a confluence of ideas from computer science, statistics, economics, physics, and others. Machine learning is transforming fields with new capabilities, ways of understanding and visualizing data, and is becoming a key driver in decision making. However, knowing when (and how) to apply appropriate machine learning techniques requires understanding of data, machine learning, and the problem domain. This class seeks to teach students how to address the entire machine learning pipeline, starting from messy data and provisional questions and ending with actionable interpretations and insights. The course will cover discovery, planning, analysis, and interpretation. Discovery involves understanding the data at hand, determining what is and is not answerable, and question generation. Planning involves contrasting the application of the desired machine learning method on ideal clean data with the messy data at hand. Dealing with representation, missing data, and designing appropriate machine learning machinery are all involved in planning. Analysis involves applying the machine learning method, checking model performance and assumptions in a principled and responsible manner. Interpretation involves the transformation of algorithm outputs into meaningful and actionable characterizations of the results. Each part of the pipeline is interconnected and students will learn to anticipate and address limitations through understanding of the pipeline as a whole. Throughout the course we will focus on one vertical, health care, recognizing that the methods developed will generalize to others. We will work with real, messy, structured and unstructured data--including databases, text, and images. We will contrast machine learning methods against what is currently used in health care analytics, and describe the advantages and promise of each.","Learning Outcomes: Students will be able to: - learn and adapt the mathematical formulations of machine learning methods for principled application - perform end-to-end machine learning analysis, including: data exploration, preparation, cleaning, prediction, validation, visualization, and interpretation - build working knowledge of a data science pipeline: e.g. R tidyverse (we will use this one for class); e.g. python scikit pandas seaborn - develop machine learning algorithms tailored to data and business or research question - understand the strengths and limitations of existing analytic strategies, including: randomized controlled trials, observational studies, Cox proportional hazards, logistic regression - write a conference-style paper in Latex - use of github for project code"

Network Situational Awareness,95855,12, The 21st century created an unprecedented dependence on the Internet that is ever changing and affects all aspects of business and communications. This change brings up challenging problems and business decisions analysts face both at the micro and macro-levels: Micro: · What is the breadth of my network? · What assets are important to my mission? · What vulnerabilities affect me? · How do I perform efficient network analysis? What does “the bad” look like? Macro: · What are the geo-political effects of various movements across the world? · How do I provide an assessment of a global problem to decision makers? · What are the downstream affects others face because of me? Business Impacts: · What will this security implementation have on my business? · What do I do if my network is being used for malicious activity? · Can I take advantage of new technologies? This is a hands-on course that will survey network situational awareness techniques. The concept of network situational awareness is to develop a cogent set of observed network characteristics that will inform decision makers as to the wise course to take in defending the network (or more colloquially Know your network.

Unstructured Data Analytics,95865,6," Companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video. How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as ""unstructured"". This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach. We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. Along the way, we encounter many of the most popular methods in analyzing unstructured data, from modern classics in manifold learning, clustering, and topic modeling to some of the latest developments in deep neural networks for analyzing text, images, and time series. We will be coding lots of Python and working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for cloud computing (including using GPUs). Note that students cannot receive credit for both 95-865 (""Unstructured Data Analytics"") and 94-775 (""Unstructured Data Analytics for Policy""). More information is available at the course webpage: http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/95-865/ Note that there will be a fair amount of coding in Python and working with sufficiently large datasets. We will be making use of standard Python machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and keras.","Learning Outcomes: By the end of the course, students are expected to have developed the following skills. Skills are assessed by the homework assignments and the final exam. * Recall and discuss common methods of conducting exploratory and predictive analysis of unstructured data; * Write Python code for exploratory and predictive data analysis that handles large datasets; and * Work with the Amazon AWS cloud computing platform; and * Apply unstructured data analysis techniques discussed in class to solve problems faced by governments and companies."
Advanced Business Analytics,95866,6," Growth in Web 2.0 coincides with the growth in firms' ability to collect large customer data. Firms know micro level data about customer transactions and have an ability to correlate such data with other datasets. In this course, we will learn powerful but simple probability/statistical models that can be applied to fit these data to generate useful predictions. The course will go beyond pattern detections, clustering, or correlation in data to build models of plausible consumer behavior that generates the data. Thus the goal is to build a ""model"" of consumer behavior and apply this model to data to test how accurate this model is and tweak it if necessary. Most importantly, with such a model in hand, we want to predict how outcomes will change if the firm changed its strategy. Thus a key goal of the course is to teach students a model based approach to prediction.",

Applied Threat Analysis,95889,12," Cyber Threat Analysts fuse several data types to provide industry and government with strategic analysis for decision makers. There is a strong need for students to develop the capability to understand cyber threats and provide actionable intelligence. This course deconstructs what governments and industry define as cyber threats by providing students with a deep understanding of vulnerabilities, exploits, malware, network communications, and actors. In addition to expanding the knowledge base of threats, the course expands the technical understanding of indicators of compromise.",
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence,95891,12," Driven by the combination of increased access to data, computational power, and improved sensors and algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are entering the mainstream of technological innovation. These technologies include search, machine learning, natural language processing, robotics and image processing. The course begins by describing what the latest generation of artificial intelligence techniques can actually do. After an introduction of some basic concepts and techniques, the course illustrates both the potential and current limitations of these techniques with examples from a variety of applications. We spend some time on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of human decision-making and learning, specifically in combination with AI systems. Exercises will include hands-on application of basic AI techniques as well as selection of appropriate technologies for a given problem and anticipation of design implications. In a final project, groups of students will participate in the creation of an AI-based application.",
Agile for Product Management,95894,6," Product Managers of software product-centric companies serve their customers with great purpose. While they hold profit and loss accountability to drive line of business performance, they are more successful when they: • Have clarity on who their stakeholders are, and set goals in service to their needs • Connect people with a vision, and clear measures of product and business success • Find the right mix of markets and innovations under investment budget constraints • Deliver the best value (now) amidst stiff competition and inherent complexity of getting to market • Prove resilient to absorb sudden change in direction, technology and other complex market conditions • Balance R&D and need for lowering operating costs at the expense of sales growth • Create sticky relationships as they involve real users and customers in product development to find what is most useful Company executives have been challenging their business and technology organizations, and lines of business to create greater ""agility"" in product delivery. We will learn what is unique about Agile Product Management and why these jobs are in such high demand. While the history and reasons for this push for Agile Methods are many (many of which we explore as the foundation of our course) this executive push for continuous improvement in product delivery presents great opportunity for Agile Product Managers to leverage important new strategies, and to truly partner in collaboration with technology teams in ways that create new, high-performance centers in the organization optimized for value creation and resiliency - such vitality under traditional ""Waterfall"" and ""Iterative"" organizations was not possible. We will deeply explore: • History of Agile Software Product Development we see in industry • Understanding how large Product organizations leverage Scrum, and why it's most common • Translating Vision into Value using feature mapping and decomposition techniques • Strategies for exploring feature ideas, technology innovation, finding what's possible • Exploring go-to-market strategies that fit your situation: Minimal Viable-Product or ""like"" strategies • Empirical release planning and forecasting on a product backlog ordered for value, not priority • Contrast how and why Scrum organizations approach ""requirements"" the various ways they • Explore how specialized strategies dove-tail with Scrum: Design Thinking, LeanStartup, DevOps and Quality Assurance and considerations that align to vision and incremental value • Explore how specialized functions/roles fit with Scrum: User Experience, Business Analysts, Architects, Business Professionals in HR, Legal, Operations, Sales, Executive Sponsors and why it matters to you • Customer and user engagement to validate incremental value and inform budgetary decision making • Your Accountability in the Product-centric organization having many expensive, dedicated, high-performance teams in service to your business and product goals; or not • Organizing around Total Cost of Ownership (return on investment, support operations, technical debt, R&D, new capital investment, maintenance, defects, enterprise forces, regulatory mandates, etc.) • Complex Enterprise organizations operating with agility and ways Product Management fits Required Purchases: • Purchase and read (or Audible books) the following o The Lean Startup, Eric Reis o The Greater Goal: Connecting Purpose and Performance, Ken Jennings and Heather Hyde","Learning Outcomes: • Students leave this course having gained hands-on Agile Product Management experience through setting and executing strategies and techniques vital to the success of today's companies • Students demonstrate critical thinking within the Scrum framework, navigating their role accountability through complex situations as Product Owner (the ""CEO of the Product"") in partnership with their technology organizations, to maximize value to the company • Students gain key role insights through case studies, story-telling and exercises, into the ways many small, large and enterprise companies are organizing for greater agility, and the role they may one day pursue as agile product managers"
