Software Engineering Intern,CrowdStrike,3.7 ,"– Los Angeles, CA, United States","CrowdStrike is a computer security company that was founded on the principle that effective computer security cannot be achieved without understanding the goals, tactics, and techniques used by determined attackers who can be expected to purposefully and repeatedly pursue their objectives to the detriment of our customers.

CrowdStrike customers include some of the largest blue-chip companies in the financial services, energy, oil & gas, telecommunications, retail, and technology sectors, along with some of the largest and most sophisticated government agencies worldwide.

CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”: a driver installed on a client machine that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, can correlate malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.

The Sensor Tools team has as its primary mission to build internal tools that help the engineering team ship high-quality sensor software. To this end, we develop platform-specific and cross-platform test and automation tools, we develop internal services that support our develop-test-release pipeline, and we develop specialized web applications which enable the engineering team to interact with and understand the development process.

Job Responsibilities:

The core of the Software Engineer for Tools and Infrastructure (SETI) job at CrowdStrike is:
Build the software which implements our inner loop and release pipeline. Examples include: REST services which allocate and destroy machines for continuous integration; CI pipeline code and libraries; interfaces that collect disparate data about our release status and display it in a meaningful summary; glue code that performs operational tasks such as logging and alerting; code which manages kernel debuggers on our test range; and many other things. We are involved in a diverse range of production tooling.
Build out best-practices tools which devs can use to avoid common problems: linters to help maintain coding style, templates for implementing microservices, and sample projects to show people how to set up build-test-deploy chains in our CI.
Collaborate with the development, test, and infrastructure engineering teams to ensure that the day-to-day work of shipping software runs smoothly.
Requirements:

We are looking for people who:
Like to understand what makes processes run smoothly, and who like to write code that improves workflows for themselves and other people.
Can communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a distributed team.
Can program computers and can demonstrate that capability, be it through job experience, schoolwork, or contributions to community projects.
Other Desirable Qualifications:

None of these qualifications are strictly required for an intern position from the outset; but it can be expected that people doing SETI work will eventually build the following kinds of qualifications:
Understanding of fundamental computer science concepts; experience in analysis and implementation of data structures, algorithms, and software design.
Ability to write and automate test cases, and to build continuous integration workflows that ship software into production with little human intervention.
Ability to read code with a focus on its robustness and security (or lack thereof).
Ability to empathize with customer problems and come up creative solutions that alleviate them.
A track record of shipping quality software.
Finally, the following skills will help an internship candidate get up to speed quickly; if you don’t have them, you can expect to learn them:
Experience with version control, especially Git; and with continuous integration tools, especially Jenkins.
Linux development experience; experience with Docker on Linux.
Front-end application development experience in JavaScript/HTML .
At this time, CrowdStrike does not sponsor visas for entry level positions.

CrowdStrike is an Equal Opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex including sexual orientation and gender identity, national origin, disability, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local law.",75000,122000,CA

"Software Engineer, Entry Level",State Street Corporation,3.1 ,"– Boston, Massachusetts","In January 2018, we launched one of the industry’s largest technical transformation projects, in effect building a new bank from the ground up. We’re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: aggressive use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, pushing out microservices into what will be one of the largest Kubernetes installations in the world, leveraging immutable storage to process and store hundreds of terabytes of data per day, transforming our industry through application of distributed ledger technology and cognitive computing, aggressively participating in open-source communities that are driving our systems.

This isn’t a traditional banking role. This is a chance to push your technical skills with people who are more comfortable in a technology firm than an investment bank, and are solving real problems that affect anyone with any form of savings worldwide. We don’t expect you to wear a suit, we don’t expect you to not be able to tell your friends what you’re working on, and we don’t expect you to sit in meetings 5 hours a day.

Specifically, the Distributed Ledger Technology (DTL) team is responsible for developing the next generation mission-critical applications for the bank. This level of transformation can only be achieved with a complete ground up redesign. New technologies (blockchain, machine learning, CI/CD, microservices, clouds) mean you get to learn a lot more and opportunities to contribute into upstream open source projects.

Primary Responsibilities:
Participating in agile development with team members.
Applying Test Driven Development methodology to code.
Engaging with lines of business, users and analysts to explore and prototype opportunities and use-cases.
Continuously learning and proactively championing new technical methods relevant to the project.

Required Qualifications:
Bachelor’s degree (or higher) in Computer Science or related field.
Solid understanding of some high level programming languages.
A natural problem solver.

The Associate Software Engineer (ASD) title is a role entry level/junior developers with up to 3 years of commercial software development experience. During project work, an ASD will be mentored heavily by both their Team Lead and other engineers, and they are expected to approach each project through a lens of learning best-practices and techniques needed to succeed, as well as finding their footing in the team dynamic. Each successive project is both valuable to the organization in some way, but heavily serves as a vehicle to develop the ASD towards the goal of designing and building their own projects. The ASD must be motivated to learn the codebase and products they work on, so as to eventually become a more independent contributor to the overall development team.

While specific tasks are generally dictated by the requirements of a given project or product, tasks common to all ASD’s include:
The ability to convert pre-designed project scopes into reality, while reporting progress and roadblocks. This includes correct time management, and adherence to assigned scope.
Ability to assume ownership of completed projects. Without a breadth of knowledge of our codebase (yet) the ASD must be the absolute subject matter expert on what they have built.
Ideal Personal Qualities:
Self-starter with high initiative
Outgoing personality and the ability to build and expand relationships with customer contacts, industry leaders, competitors, and partners
Highly organized
