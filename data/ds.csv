Associate Staff Scientist [Precision Timing and Synchronization],,3.9 ,,"The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is the world's first hard X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) and operates as a user facility for a global community of scientists, providing ultrashort, ultra-bright pulses of X-rays to seven experimental instruments focused on specific areas of science. A unique characteristic of XFELs such as LCLS is the ability to produce few to sub-femtosecond x-ray pulses and to employ optical lasers for pump/probe characterization of the ultrafast properties of atoms, molecules, and bulk materials. There are significant challenges to measure such short x-ray pulse durations and to maintain few- or sub-femtosecond relative timing between the x-rays and pump lasers. The science reach of the new, high repetition rate x-ray source, LCLS-II, will be enhanced by improved timing and synchronization between the x-ray beam and optical lasers used in pump/probe experiments and the characterization of ultrashort x-ray pulses, from few-femtosecond to eventually attosecond resolution. For the most precise relative timing, x-ray/optical cross-correlation techniques must be implemented, and significant development is required to develop these techniques to be compatible with the high rep-rate and diverse characteristics of the x-ray beam for LCLS-II.

We are looking for an Associate Staff scientist with a background in ultrafast laser to join our team and participate in our program for the development, commissioning, and operation of our precision timing and synchronization systems, specifically: (1) the development and facility integration of high precision timing and synchronization systems based on transmission of lasers over optical fibers; (2) the development of X-ray/optical cross-correlation techniques compatible with the science drivers and capabilities of LCLS-II. In this position you will report to the Department Head for Precision Timing, Synchronization, and Distribution group within our LCLS Laser Division.

Your responsibilities include:
