The spectrum of responsibilities for this team ranges from 'now decisions' (e.g.: what is the ROI for a particular campaign for last week & should it continue) to long term planning and strategy (e.g.: what should we spend next quarter in paid search?)

We strive to execute best in class measurement and analytics strategies. Every day. We're an intellectually curious team and are proud to be the unbiased voice for measuring successes that drive business results. Yes, we work at a fortune 500 company, but we strive to operate like a start-up - seriously, that's the dream - resources of a large firm and the autonomy of a startup!! (And at Allstate you are in 'good hands' - no pun intended). We are on a journey to build out the best in class team and are looking for enthusiastic, driven professionals. We hire people who love what they do, not skill sets. So, here's a litmus test:
Are you picky about pulling your own data, applying an analytic layer on the data for answering a business question?
Does the thought of working hands-on with industry leading digital data sets excite you (think Google, Facebook, marketing attribution)?
Have you developed Tableau dashboards that transform complex data sets into easy to digest and actionable visualizations?
Are you interested in conducting experimental designs in SAS in order to test & learn how to optimize marketing spend?
If you answered Yes to 3 of the 4 questions above you are likely an ideal candidate to join the Marketing Measurement Science team at Allstate and we look forward to meeting you!

Job Description

As a member of the Marketing Measurement Science team, you will get the opportunity to be on the front lines working with Sr. Managers and Directors of Allstate's marketing team. You will be working with business and marketing leaders, every day, to make real business impact. A brief blurb of what this job is about:
You will enjoy working with one of the broadest marketing mixes on the planet. We've got it all - from traditional TV/radio to Snapchat - you'll find we have a marketing campaign for all eyeballs in the US!
You will get a chance to apply your first-principles knowledge of statistics to real world experimental design to measure the effectiveness of a campaign (all those hours you spent taking statistics 101 now finally has a purpose!)
You will contribute to work on data and problems across Marketing to drive improved business results through designing, building, and partnering to implement analytical processes
You will collaborate with the team to improve the effectiveness of marketing investment decisions through the creation of scalable analytics and rigorous deep-dives
You will develop and deliver insight that explains current campaign performance, and work with your manager to turn that insight into recommendations for future campaign improvement
You will work with your manager to develop effective project planning techniques to break down projects into tasks, and ensure deadlines are kept
You will maximize your personal professional development to ensure continuation of a personal contribution to the team and Allstate
In essence, the scope is huge, the only limitation is your will!

Job Qualifications
The perfect candidate will have a background in a quantitative or technical field, will have experience working with large data sets, and will have some experience in data-driven decision making
You are focused on results, a self-starter, and have demonstrated success in using analytics to drive the understanding, growth, and success of a product/campaign/program.
You have the analytic agility to deal with a variety of problems and quickly arrive at 'what needs to be done' and you do it
You have the ability to communicate complex analysis to non-technical audiences and the ability to deal with 'Nay Sayers' of your analysis in a respectful manner
You are able to operate independently (but you can also work in teams effectively), are detail-oriented, and deliver results in a highly organized manner
Bachelors or Master's preferred in a quantitative field such as statistics, mathematics, finance, or economics
Demonstrated experience/expertise with at least one with statistical software such as SAS and R and a passion for data driven decision-making
Experience with distributed computing (Hive/Hadoop)
Development experience in any scripting language (PHP, Python, Perl, etc.) is a huge plus
The candidate(s) offered this position will be required to submit to a background investigation, which includes a drug screen.
Good Work. Good Life. Good Hands.
As a Fortune 100 company and industry leader, we provide a competitive salary - but that's just the beginning. Our Total Rewards package also offers benefits like tuition assistance, medical and dental insurance, as well as a robust pension and 401(k).

Education

BASIC REQUIREMENTS:

Applicants who meet the basic requirements described in the individual occupational requirements are fully qualified for the specified entry grade (generally grade GS-5). Applicants who wish to qualify for positions at higher grade levels (generally grade GS-7 and above) must also meet the requirements shown in the table on page IV-A-22, in addition to meeting the basic requirements.

The individual occupational requirements typically provide at least two methods for applicants to meet the basic requirements of the occupations covered by this standard:

Successful completion of a full 4-year course of study in an accredited college or university leading to a bachelor's or higher degree that included a major field of study or specific course requirements generally as stated in paragraph A in the individual occupational requirements.

Where specific course requirements are not indicated in paragraph A, the number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the amount specified by the college or university attended. If this number cannot be obtained, 24 semester hours will be considered as equivalent to a major field of study. The nature and quality of this required course work must have been such that it would serve as a prerequisite for more advanced study in the field or subject-matter area. Related course work generally refers to courses that may be accepted as part of the program major.

Appropriate combination of education and experience that is typically specified in paragraph B of the individual occupational requirements. The ""paragraph B"" method generally requires that an applicant possess a core of educational credit, such as described in paragraph A above, plus additional education and/or experience. The method of determining the number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the same as described in paragraph A.

The quality of the combination of education and experience must be sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant possesses the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform work in the occupation, and is comparable to that normally acquired through the successful completion of a full 4-year course of study with a major in the appropriate field. In addition to courses in the major and related fields, a typical college degree would have included courses that involved analysis, writing, critical thinking, research, etc. These courses would have provided an applicant with skills and abilities sufficient to perform progressively more responsible work in the occupation. Therefore, creditable experience should have demonstrated similarly appropriate skills or abilities needed to perform the work of the occupation.

The individual occupational requirements for some series make no provision for combining experience and education. Therefore, they do not include paragraph B provisions.

For a small number of occupations or positions covered by this standard, applicants may possess certain kinds of experience in lieu of education. In such cases, applicants may meet minimum qualification requirements through experience equivalent to a 4-year degree. These situations are generally described in paragraph C of the individual occupational requirements.

Applicants whose experience is used to meet the basic requirements through a paragraph B or C provision may qualify for grades above the entry level if that experience includes 1 year of specialized experience. In such cases, the specialized experience would have to be evaluated to determine if it is at the appropriate grade level in the normal line of progression."

Education

BASIC REQUIREMENTS:

Applicants who meet the basic requirements described in the individual occupational requirements are fully qualified for the specified entry grade (generally grade GS-5). Applicants who wish to qualify for positions at higher grade levels (generally grade GS-7 and above) must also meet the requirements shown in the table on page IV-A-22, in addition to meeting the basic requirements.

The individual occupational requirements typically provide at least two methods for applicants to meet the basic requirements of the occupations covered by this standard:

Successful completion of a full 4-year course of study in an accredited college or university leading to a bachelor's or higher degree that included a major field of study or specific course requirements generally as stated in paragraph A in the individual occupational requirements.

Where specific course requirements are not indicated in paragraph A, the number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the amount specified by the college or university attended. If this number cannot be obtained, 24 semester hours will be considered as equivalent to a major field of study. The nature and quality of this required course work must have been such that it would serve as a prerequisite for more advanced study in the field or subject-matter area. Related course work generally refers to courses that may be accepted as part of the program major.

Appropriate combination of education and experience that is typically specified in paragraph B of the individual occupational requirements. The ""paragraph B"" method generally requires that an applicant possess a core of educational credit, such as described in paragraph A above, plus additional education and/or experience. The method of determining the number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the same as described in paragraph A.

The quality of the combination of education and experience must be sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant possesses the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform work in the occupation, and is comparable to that normally acquired through the successful completion of a full 4-year course of study with a major in the appropriate field. In addition to courses in the major and related fields, a typical college degree would have included courses that involved analysis, writing, critical thinking, research, etc. These courses would have provided an applicant with skills and abilities sufficient to perform progressively more responsible work in the occupation. Therefore, creditable experience should have demonstrated similarly appropriate skills or abilities needed to perform the work of the occupation.

The individual occupational requirements for some series make no provision for combining experience and education. Therefore, they do not include paragraph B provisions.

For a small number of occupations or positions covered by this standard, applicants may possess certain kinds of experience in lieu of education. In such cases, applicants may meet minimum qualification requirements through experience equivalent to a 4-year degree. These situations are generally described in paragraph C of the individual occupational requirements.

Applicants whose experience is used to meet the basic requirements through a paragraph B or C provision may qualify for grades above the entry level if that experience includes 1 year of specialized experience. In such cases, the specialized experience would have to be evaluated to determine if it is at the appropriate grade level in the normal line of progression.

Additional information
This position is covered by the Department of Defense Priority Placement Program.

Several vacancies may be filled at the following grade levels:
GS-07 target GS-13; salary range: $48,403 to $62,922
