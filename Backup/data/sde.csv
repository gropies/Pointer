Software Engineer - University Graduate (Entry Level),Snowflake,4.7 ★,$62k-$103k(Glassdoor est.),"– Boston, Massachusetts","In January 2018, we launched one of the industry’s largest technical transformation projects, in effect building a new bank from the ground up. We’re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: aggressive use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, pushing out microservices into what will be one of the largest Kubernetes installations in the world, leveraging immutable storage to process and store hundreds of terabytes of data per day, transforming our industry through application of distributed ledger technology and cognitive computing, aggressively participating in open-source communities that are driving our systems.

Specifically, the Distributed Ledger Technology (DTL) team is responsible for developing the next generation mission-critical applications for the bank. This level of transformation can only be achieved with a complete ground up redesign. New technologies (blockchain, machine learning, CI/CD, microservices, clouds) mean you get to learn a lot more and opportunities to contribute into upstream open source projects.
Primary Responsibilities:
* Participating in agile development with team members.
* Applying Test Driven Development methodology to code.
* Engaging with lines of business, users and analysts to explore and prototype opportunities and use-cases.

This level of transformation can only be achieved with a complete ground up redesign. New technologies (blockchain, machine learning, CI/CD, microservices, clouds) mean you get to learn a lot more and opportunities to contribute into upstream open source projects.
Primary Responsibilities:
* Participating in agile development with team members.
* Applying Test Driven Development methodology to code.
* Engaging with lines of business, users and analysts to explore and prototype opportunities and use-cases.

Department Description

The Dispatch Consoles team focuses on a set of products purpose built for mission-critical operation over public safety communication networks. Dispatch Consoles provide a view into the communications system, with ability to monitor multiple communications channels simultaneously. Radio Dispatch operators and 911 call-takers use the Dispatch Console to communicate with first responders in the field and coordinate incident management among police, fire, emergency medical and other agencies.

Motorola Dispatch Consoles interoperate with a wide array of communications technologies including analog and digital radio channels, tone paging, telephone; and also supports auxiliary connections for sensors, I/O controls and additional peripherals devices such as speakers, microphones, and headsets. Dispatch Consoles bring these elements together in a single product designed to present information from these sources in efficient workflows to help first responders perform their duties quickly and accurately.

Motorola IP-based Dispatch Consoles enable effective, secure communication over public safety communication networks to keep responders connected and informed when it matters most.

Motorola Dispatch Consoles offer public safety and utility agencies integration capabilities to reach across multiple applications and resources for enhanced response coordination. A highly intuitive interface increases ease of use for organizing resources, coordinating a response and communicating valuable information.

Audio processing, encryption, and switching intelligence for dispatch is performed within each software-based operator position, without additional centralized electronics. MCC 7500 consoles function as integrated components of the entire radio system, enabling full participation in system level features such as end-to-end encryption and agency partitioning. A Motorola dispatch console is able to monitor up to 180 communications channels simultaneously.

The Associate Software Engineer (ASD) title is a role entry level/junior developers with up to 3 years of commercial software development experience. During project work, an ASD will be mentored heavily by both their Team Lead and other engineers, and they are expected to approach each project through a lens of learning best-practices and techniques needed to succeed, as well as finding their footing in the team dynamic. Each successive project is both valuable to the organization in some way, but heavily serves as a vehicle to develop the ASD towards the goal of designing and building their own projects. The ASD must be motivated to learn the codebase and products they work on, so as to eventually become a more independent contributor to the overall development team.

While specific tasks are generally dictated by the requirements of a given project or product, tasks common to all ASD’s include:
The ability to convert pre-designed project scopes into reality, while reporting progress and roadblocks. This includes correct time management, and adherence to assigned scope.
Ability to assume ownership of completed projects. Without a breadth of knowledge of our codebase (yet) the ASD must be the absolute subject matter expert on what they have built.
Ideal Personal Qualities:
Self-starter with high initiative
Outgoing personality and the ability to build and expand relationships with customer contacts, industry leaders, competitors, and partners
Highly organized
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Business maturity with a “Can-do” attitude
Ideal Technical Qualities:
General knowledge of Windows Server infrastructure and Windows networking
General knowledge of Windows platform infrastructure (Web Services, ASP.Net, IIS, Web API)
Working knowledge of Windows (.NET) platform software development, specifically C#
Working knowledge of JavaScript and at least one Web Application Framework (AngularJS, React)
Working knowledge of databases, specifically Microsoft SQL Server and MongoDB
